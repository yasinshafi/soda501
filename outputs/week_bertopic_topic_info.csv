Peter earns failing grades from his professor, who is also his father  and unable to graduate he becomes bitter and disillusioned. He then meets up with the free spirited Bogart . The two of them go back to her apartment after a night of drinking and have casual sex. Afterwards she gets up to go for a drive and asks Peter if he\'d like to come, to which he agrees. The two of them drive northwards through the night and Peter eventually falls asleep. When he wakes up, he finds that Bogart has driven him all the way to Humboldt County. It is here that he meets her family. Jack  and Rosie  took her in when her family abandoned her, and they became her surrogate parents. He also meets Max ([[Chris Messina , Jack and Rosie\'s son and Charity , Max\'s daughter. After an uncomfortable night in which Peter finds out that they are all involved in farming pot, he finally manages to go to sleep. He is woken up in the morning by Max, who plays a prank on him which involved pretending to be shot and having a fake blood-covered Charity pretend to be dying. When he gets dressed, he finds out that Bogart has left. Stranded and unwilling to call his father for help, Peter\'s only choice is to take the bus, which won\'t come for another day. Max enlists him to help him with his marijuana crop, to which Peter reluctantly complies. After a day of working on some irrigation problems, they relax back at Jack and Rosie\'s. Bob and Steve , friends of Max arrive bloodied and dirty. Some local hicks found their garden, roughed them both up and stole their plants. The next day, Peter helps Max again with his plants. He becomes so focused on it that he misses the bus again. It is after this that he begins to bond with Max and the rest of his family. He quickly falls in love with the place and stops trying to leave, developing feelings similar to Stockholm Syndrome. He begins to understand empathy and love . When Jack asks him what he plans to do after this, Peter is stunned to realize that he\'d never thought that there would be an ""after this"". His sudden fear that he\'d never leave is furthered by a conversation that he has with Bob and Steve in a bar. Steve explains that almost everyone who is in Humboldt County now came there from somewhere else and never left, including Jack and Rosie. He also reveals that he was in Peter\'s shoes a few years earlier; he was a student at Stanford and followed a girl here and never left. When Peter doubts that their scenarios were the same, Steve also mentions that the girl he followed was Bogart. When they get up to leave, Bob refuses because he sees the guys that stole their plants sitting at a table behind them. While he and Steve argue about whether or not he\'s actually going to say something, Peter drunkenly walks over and confronts them. He then throws his drink in one of their faces and they all run out of the bar with the hicks in pursuit. They get away and are walking through the woods, laughing about what Peter had just done when Steve says that he wants to show them something. He takes them up to an unfamiliar area of the woods where there is a massive plantation, at least fifty plants. Steve and Bob start to steal a couple because they figured that no one would notice. At this time, Peter notices a sleeping bag on the ground just seconds before someone fires a shotgun at them. As they run away, Peter stops and looks back and sees that the person chasing them is Max. It\'s revealed that this is his secret garden. Max is angry and feels betrayed that he caught Peter stealing his plants and he yells at him to leave. When Peter gets back to Jack\'s, Jack confronts him and asks him how many plants Max has. At first, he is hesitant to answer, so Jack takes him out on a nature walk and explains to him the dangers of having more than a few plants. He believes that by growing only twenty plants, he makes enough to get by and keeps from attracting the fed\'s attention. He warns Peter against letting greed run his life, because doing so destroys the entire reason they came out to the lost coast in the first place. After this, he goes to Max\'s house and asks him why he didn\'t tell him about the other plants. It\'s at this time that a federal police cruiser comes by and arrests Peter and Max. Peter is interrogated, but he reveals nothing and they are let go. Afterwards Peter starts to question why he is still there. The next day, Jack has a BBQ. He confronts Max about his secret crop. Without answering his question, Max instead mocks Jack, saying that the feds are probably there for all of the research that Jack has been doing all of these years. Jack angrily storms off and Rosie reveals to Peter that Jack isn\'t Max\'s father. Jack, Rosie and her then-husband, Charlie were all friends when they worked as professors at UCLA and they decided to move to Humboldt County together. However, eventually Charlie, who had been a long time alcoholic and drinking buddy of Jack\'s, died in a car accident while suffering from an episode of extreme alcohol withdrawal. Peter decides that he can\'t be a part of Max\'s operation any more and he tries to leave. Max gets angry and tells him that this isn\'t a game and he can\'t back out, but Peter starts walking away anyway. Max then starts to cry and tells Peter that if he doesn\'t pull this off, Charity will end up just like him. While this affects Peter greatly, he still continues to walk off. Charity then finds Peter crying by a tree and asks him what\'s wrong. He asks her what she wants to be when she grows up and she says an astronaut. When she asks him what he wants to be, he says that he no longer knows, and she says that that\'s all right, which comforts Peter. The next day, Peter\'s father shows up at the house, using Star-69 and MapQuest he managed to find where Peter was. After a brief visit with Jack and Rosie, where he is greatly put off to find that this is where his son has been all this time, he tells Peter that they\'re leaving, and Peter reluctantly goes with him despite his new-found bond with Jack and Rosie. As they\'re driving, his father tells Peter that he decided to pass him, but this news doesn\'t affect Peter much. He then sees Bob and Steve speeding down the road in the opposite direction, followed by Max and then by a federal helicopter. Peter realizes that they must have found Max\'s secret crop and are on their way to raid it. He gets out of the car and tells his father to head for the beach  and he runs off to stop Max from trying to save his crop. Peter\'s father gets to the beach, where he finds Jack along with all of the other local pot farmers. He informs him that Peter took off. Jack hadn\'t seen Max anywhere and he connected the dots and headed off towards Max\'s crop. When Peter gets there, he finds Max trying to save as many of his plants before the DEA gets there and Peter begins to help. Then the feds show up and Peter and Max narrowly manage to hide themselves. Then Jack shows up and leads them both back to the beach, where Charity happily reunites with Max. Peter says that he\'s sorry to Max for his loss and Max tells him not to take it so seriously. That night, Max is at the bar drowning his sorrows when his drunken behavior gets him kicked out. He is then seen driving down the highway and laughing to himself. The scene then cuts to the next day when a sheriff shows up at Jack and Rosie\'s and informs them that Max is dead. They then call Peter, who is staying at a hotel with his father, and tell him. He attends the funeral and afterwards finds Jack in his study, weeping to himself. Jack is ridden with guilt, he says that it was his idea to come up there and he blames himself for the death of Charlie and now Max. He breaks down saying that he has nothing left, but Peter then tells him that has so much left and that he had not yet reached the event horizon . The ending is left up to the viewer for interpretation. It shows Peter and his father having breakfast at a diner before leaving back for Los Angeles. A bus then pulls up outside as one of the passengers needs to use the bathroom. Peter then gets up – his father apparently assuming he is going to the bathroom – and heads outside and gets on the bus, which then leaves when the other passenger gets back.', '{{plot}} It is Wednesday, October 2, 1968, and a middle-class Mexican family is about to start the day. At breakfast, the older brothers, Jorge  and Sergio  argue with their father Humberto . The boys are studying at the university and their father works at the Departamento del Distrito Federal . The argument begins when the father complains that the boys have long hair. The argument escalates and then they begin to argue that what the boys are doing is wrong, and that ""no one should question the government"". The boys say that the autonomy of the university was violated and that the government does things against the constitution. Their grandfather Roque  , says that ""If they were on a real revolution, they would be executed"". The younger siblings Carlos  and Graciela , who study primary and secondary school, barely understand what the argument is all about, because of their young age. The boys then talk about the injustice of the government. Their prime example is the occupation of the U.N.A.M. and that some students hid in the bathroom, and their corpses were found the day before . The mother, Alicia  tries to calm down the situation and tells the boys to ""come early and cut their hair"". The boys jokingly state that Miguel Hidalgo had long hair , then leave. The day continues normally and then, while cooking, Alicia and Graciela argue about what the boys are doing. Graciela says that her mother is ""out of style"", then says that she would like to continue studying, to which her mother replies that she will end up being a homemaker anyway. Carlos is getting ready for school while listening to the Beatles, his grandfather complains that ""they\'re too loud"" and turns the radio off. Humberto tries to call his wife and tells her that ""something big is about to happen and that he is worried"", but before he can continue the phone dies. Alicia asks Graciela to go to the neighbor\'s apartment and try to call her father. Graciela does so and finds out that the neighbor\'s phone is dead. She returns and says that the phones do not work, ""neither ours, nor the neighbor\'s, nor the one in the corner"". Sometime later, the light goes out as well. Don Roque goes to the bottom floor and changes the fuse. He bumps into the neighbor on the way and they both change fuses. They then try to turn on the light and discover that the light got cut out. Don Roque then returns to the apartment and tells Alicia that the light does not work. They both worry and carry on with their day. Carlos returns from school. He tells his mother that he asked the teacher whether what his brothers said was true, and says the teacher confirmed it. He then goes outside to the building\'s hall to play with his toy soldiers with his grandfather. As they are playing, suspicious men with sniper rifles and white handkerchiefs in their left hands try to take a look through an opening on the hall. They find it ""inappropriate"" and go to upstairs floors. The two return to the apartment and Don Roque talks with his daughter about the military presence and the snipers at the roof of each building. Why? She asks. The answer is very simple: because they are prepared for something big. Alicia starts sewing something, Carlos does his homework and Don Roque tries to repair a watch. At the square outside, a crowd begins to gather. A student meeting is taking place. Carlos and Graciela watch the crowd and estimate more than 10,000 present. Graciela then goes to a friend\'s house to do her homework. After half an hour, the meeting is interrupted as red and green flares soar across the sky. Carlos sees this, excited, and tells his mom. Alicia peeks through the window and sees that the students are being slaughtered. Don Roque tells them to get away from the window and to hide in his room. As they do so, two bullets pierce the window. After some time, Don Roque tries to pick up Graciela, but before he does, he hears a sound. ""Tanks!"" he exclaims. Then it starts to rain. After some time, there are sounds from outside. The door opens and Serigio and Jorge  arrive, along with some mates. One of them, Luis , is wounded. Alicia tries to heal him, but he is bleeding badly. The shooting goes on and stops. During that time, the soaked students begin to trade stories. One of them says that he was on the building\'s third floor balcony, where the speech was being given, and said that armed people dressed as civilians yelled ""Olimpia Batallion! Nobody move!"". Another one says that he was leaving when the shooting started. The brothers say that the speaker yelled to the crowd ""not to fall on provocations"". Luis says that he was from the ""Poli""  and was running with the crowd when he felt pain in his elbow, then found out he was shot, then afterwards lost his little sister. Another one claims that two dead children no older than 10 ended up on top of each other. A female student claims she saw the Plaza full of shoes. The students peek through the pierced window and see ""nothing but shadows"" . Don Roque arrives with Graciela and some soldiers, who are in the search for students. Don Roque says that he was a captain in the Revolution and searches for his papers. As he does so, the snipers come from upstairs holding three blood-soaked students. They punch them and then are told to ""take them with the others"". Don Roque comes back and gives his papers to the soldier, who tells them not to open to anyone. The old man goes back inside and says that the students were arrested and sent to military trucks, as well as that there were garbage trucks and firemen outside. Graciela says that they had to take the stairs and saw the elevator\'s doors pierced by bullets. Her mother says that it was practically impossible since they were ""made of thick steel"". The female student, who held the propaganda money, talks with Alicia. Alicia keeps the money on a jar until ""things get calm"", then says that the girl\'s parents would be worried, but the girl does not think so. Alicia says that it was impossible, ""by this time, the whole country is already aware of what happened here"", but the girl answers that ""not everything that the news says is true, and not everything that happens makes it into the news as well"". She goes into the bathroom to dry her soaked hair, when Graciela confronts her telling her ""to be a woman and not to be in Men Things"", to which the student replies ""this is a matter of both men and women"". Humberto calls and tells the family not to open to anyone. In a short time, some boys call their houses to assure their families they\'re OK. A second shooting ensues and the lights are shut down. The group sleeps and a woman starts crying outside looking for his son ""Toño"". The students awake and ask if anyone is named Toño. None of them is named like so. Finally, the lights come back on and Humberto arrives. He says that ""it was really hard to get past the security"". He also says that ambulances were on the surrounding area of the square, but none of them seemed to take the wounded to hospitals and that students were stripped and pushed to the bottom floor\'s elevator walls. One of the students asks whether they were being beaten up. Humberto confirms this harshly. They then turn the T.V. on and the local news says that the shooting took place because ""student snipers on the nearby buildings fired at the army, which was sent to support the police"". One of the students says the obvious: the government controls the local news as well, confirming the female student\'s claims. The group then goes to sleep, while the students plan their escape: the next day they\'ll ""leave the house one by one"". At the eerie sights of morning, the snipers bang on the door. After a harsh awakening, the students hide in the bathroom and one of them tells Humberto not to open. Carlos hides under his bed and the boys pretend to be asleep. Humberto asks who they are, but the snipers insist on opening. Humberto opens and the snipers act fiercely, pointing their guns at everyone. Humberto tells them of his position at the government, but they don\'t seem to care. They force everyone out of their beds and discover the boys\' room full of leftist propaganda: ""The Communist Manifesto"" and a Che Guevara poster on their wall. They are forced to get out of their room and are asked if they were in on the meeting. Jorge answers, but Sergio does not and is pistol-whipped. They discover the bathroom is locked and Don Roque says Carlos is inside because he\'s scared. They then inspect the apartment because of the boys\' leftist propaganda and find the blood-stained sheet on which Luis laid. Then they threaten to kill Humberto at gunpoint if the bathroom door does not open. Sergio, his mouth still full of blood, begs his mates to open the door. One of the snipers, meanwhile, shoots the doorknob of the bathroom and force everyone to leave. Some students stay put, while a student and the girl try to escape. Both are shot by the snipers. Other students also shout and are killed. A fight ensues. Jorge, Don Roque and Humberto try to over-power the snipers as Sergio and Graciela escape. The snipers win and shoot everyone. They then run to the hall to search for Sergio and Graciela. Two gunshots are heard. Carlos is the sole survivor as he gets out of his bed and sees the corpses in the hall. He starts to cry and goes barefoot down the blood-stained stairs. He sees his brother\'s corpse on the stairs with two bullet holes on his chest, then keeps walking down and finds his sister dead in at the foot of some stairs. He manages to get to the bullet-hit bottom floor and sees two soldiers, while in the background a government janitor  sweeps the floor, which contains student propaganda, finally the film ends.', 'Spencer ""Spence"" Scott  is a 17-year old black high school senior who has lived his entire life in a middle-class white neighborhood of an unnamed city in the northern United States. Having been raised with a sense of self-respect, he is starting to become frustrated by the effects of racism. When his history teacher speaks ill of the intellect of black slaves during the American Civil War, he objects, and when the teacher dismisses the objection, he storms angrily out of the classroom and slips to into the bathroom to calm down by smoking a cigar. He is discovered there and is suspended from school. At the same time, his white friends are beginning to exclude him from their activities because they want to include girls, and none of the girls\' parents approve of their daughters socializing in circles that include a black boy. Spence confides in ""Gram"" , his ailing but wise grandmother, but he cannot face the prospect of telling his parents  what has happened, so he decides to leave home, catching a bus into a black neighborhood. His time on his own is short-lived, however, as he is socially unprepared for an adult world. Although he is intelligent and well-read, he finds that his academic knowledge doesn\'t carry him far, as he approaches an attractive older woman in a bar, presenting to her a very logical case as to why he\'d be a good boyfriend, and assuring her that he\'d be willing to marry if they were to fall in love. He is disillusioned to discover that the woman is unhappily married and wants only to find a man in the bar who has some money and a nice car, so that she can have a one-night fling with him to temporarily escape from her troubles. Upon returning home, Spence\'s parents berate him for not having stayed ""in his place"" when dealing with white people, as they have learned to do. Spence tells them that he ashamed of them for that attitude and Gram comes to Spence\'s defense, chiding the couple for not supporting him in his stance against his teacher\'s racism. She notes that they moved to the middle-class neighborhood to help instill in Spence a sense of self-respect that he might not have attained if he\'d grown up in a slum, but they are now angry at him for displaying that very self-respect. She also criticizes their emphasis on providing him material comforts, as opposed to spending time with him, as evidenced by the fact that they are completely unaware of his having recently become something of an outcast among his peers. After Gram dies, Spence turns to Christine , the Scotts\' housekeeper. He confesses to her both his sexual frustration and his overall loneliness. He proposes that since Christine is lonely also &mdash; she is a widow, her only child was stillborn, and she is probably over a thousand miles removed from any of her family &mdash; they might find some happiness together for a short time, even if their age difference precludes a long-term relationship. To her own surprise, Christine finds that she is actually considering the idea, but the decision is made for her when she is terminated from the household. Spence\'s mother reasons that with the family no longer needing anyone to look after Gram, a housekeeper is unnecessary. She is also perceptive enough to be wary of a possible romantic relationship developing between Spence and Christine. Frustrated by his mother\'s decision and the fact that she has asked his friends to come over and spend time with him, Spence grows very angry at her over the idea of his having to beg people to be friends with him. His mother grows just as angry in return, insisting he will learn that having to swallow such humiliations is just part of being black in white-dominated world. Unable to discern any course of action that will alleviate his current unhappiness, Spence ultimately decides simply to persevere and focus upon building a brighter future for himself. He politely tells his friends that he won\'t be able to see them anymore, later explaining to his mother that he ""said goodbye to them before they say it to me"" because he had accepted that they were only his friends ""up to a point"". His mother still doesn\'t believe that was the right course of action, but says that she only wants him to be happy and the film ends with the two affirming their love for one another.']"

However, she gets a frantic phone call from her friend Brenda , who has run away from home, asking her to come pick her up after running out of money from the cab ride to the bus station. She takes Brad, Sara, and Brad\'s friend Daryl Coopersmith  and sets out, but they get a flat tire, find the spare compartment empty, and become stranded on the expressway. A friendly tow truck driver, ""Handsome"" John Pruitt , offers to replace the tire for free. En route to the garage, he gets a call on his CB saying that his wife is cheating on him and he heads home. A brief shootout ensues and during their scramble to get away, the kids unwittingly climb into a Cadillac just as it is being hotwired by a professional car thief, Joe Gipp . Gipp promises to help them get on their way home but not before bringing them to a chop shop, where they are briefly detained. Daryl finds a Playboy magazine and steals it before they escape onto the building\'s roof; however, it contains incriminating notes and the car thieves follow them. They stumble into a Blues club and are forced to sing about their ordeal by Albert Collins, receiving applause from the audience. Billy Branch plays himself as the harmonica player in this scene. After they have left, the car thieves are held up when they are forced to do the same thing. The car thieves manage to once again catch up to the kids, but the four narrowly escape by stowing away aboard a Chicago \'L\' train. Inside the near-empty train, Chris and the children become suddenly caught in the middle of a gang fight in which Brad is injured and taken to the hospital . They again encounter Pruitt, who is on the run due to his earlier fight. He tells them that his boss Dawson fixed their car, but he will force them to pay $50 for the tire. They then come across a college fraternity party at which Chris meets a new love interest, Dan Lynch , who manages to gather $45 for them. Daryl almost gets into a fight with a jock whose lonely girlfriend attempts to make out with him. Dan then drives them to Dawson\'s garage. In the garage, Dawson  appears, and Sara believes he is the superhero Thor. He refuses to release their car due to the $5 shortage, but she pleads with him and gives him her plastic helmet, causing him to change his mind, and he allows them to take the car. On their way through the city, they pass by the restaurant to where Mike was going to bring Chris on their date, and Daryl spots his car parked out front. She goes in to find him flirting with the sleazy Sesame Plexer. Brad and Daryl stand up to him when he insults her. Meanwhile, Sara wanders off and is spotted by Graydon, one of the car thieves. She is chased to the Smurfit-Stone Building where her parents are attending a party. She goes to the renovated top floor and uses a rope to slip out the window. He discovers her and attempts to climb outside with her as she dangles precariously. Chris, Daryl, and Brad go on to the top floor after seeing her out the window and rescue her. They successfully pick up Brenda and get home, and Chris sends the kids upstairs while she quickly tidies up the mess left earlier in the day. She settles in just as Mr. and Mrs. Anderson walk in through the door. She goes up to say good night to the kids and they all thank each other for the greatest night of their lives. As she leaves, Dan shows up to return Sara\'s skate which she had accidentally left behind, but notes that wasn\'t the only reason, and they share a kiss. A post-credits scene shows Graydon still leaning against the side of the building, desperately waiting for rescue.', 'With the exception of the opening and final scenes, which depict the 1941 suicide by drowning of Virginia Woolf  in the River Ouse, the action takes place within the span of a single day in three different years, and alternates among them throughout the film. In 1923, renowned author Woolf has begun writing the book Mrs Dalloway in her home in the town of Richmond outside London. In 1951, troubled Los Angeles housewife Laura Brown  escapes from her life as a conventional housewife by reading Mrs Dalloway. In 2001, New Yorker Clarissa Vaughan  is the embodiment of the title character of Mrs Dalloway as she spends the day preparing for a party she is hosting in honor of her former lover and friend Richard , a poet and author living with AIDS who is to receive an award for career achievement. Richard tells Clarissa he has stayed alive for her sake, and the award is meaningless because he didn\'t get it sooner, until he was on the brink of death. She tells him she believes he would have won the award regardless of his illness. Richard often refers to Clarissa as ""Mrs. Dalloway"", due to her distracting herself from her own life and self the way the Woolf character did. Virginia, who has experienced several nervous breakdowns and suffers from bipolar disorder, feels trapped in her home, intimidated by servants and constantly under the eye of her husband Leonard  who has begun a publishing business, Hogarth Press, at home to stay close to her. Woolf both welcomes and dreads an afternoon visit from her sister Vanessa  and her children. After their departure, Virginia flees to the railway station where she is awaiting a train to central London when Leonard arrives to bring her home. He tells her how he lives in constant fear that she will take her own life. She says she fears it also, but argues that if she is to live she has the right to decide how, and where, as much as any other. Very pregnant with her second child, Laura spends her days in her tract home with her young son, Richie. She married her husband, Dan , soon after World War II and on the surface they are living the American Dream but she is deeply unhappy. She and Richie make a cake for Dan\'s birthday, but it is a disaster. Her neighbour Kitty  drops in to ask her if she can feed her dog while she\'s in the hospital for a procedure. Kitty pretends to be upbeat, but Laura senses her fear and boldly kisses her on the lips. Kitty accepts the kiss without comment, and both women ignore any hidden meaning it might have. Laura and Richie successfully make another cake and clean up, and then she takes Richie to stay with Mrs. Latch . He is terrified of being left without her and she insists she will be back, but instead of running errands she checks into a hotel where she intends to commit suicide. Laura removes several bottles of pills and Woolf\'s novel from her purse, and begins to read Mrs Dalloway. She drifts off to sleep, and dreams the hotel room is flooded, awakening with a change of heart, and caresses her belly. She picks up Richie and they return home to celebrate Dan\'s birthday. Clarissa appears equally worried about Richard, and his depression, and the party she is planning for him. Although Clarissa herself is a lesbian who has been living with Sally Lester  for 10 years, she and Richard were lovers during their college days, and he has spent the better part of his life in gay relationships, including one with Louis Waters , who left him years ago but returns for the festivities. Clarissa\'s daughter, Julia , comes home to help her prepare. Richard has taken all sorts of pills but tells her Clarissa is the most beautiful thing he ever had in life, before he throws himself out a window to his death. Later that night Laura, who is Richard\'s mother, arrives at Clarissa\'s apartment. It is clear that Laura\'s abandonment of her family was a profound trauma for Richard, but Laura reveals it was a better decision for her to leave the family after the birth of her daughter, rather than commit suicide. She has led an independent, happier life as a librarian in Canada. She does not apologize for the hurt she caused to her family , and suggests that it\'s not possible to feel regret for something over which she had no choice. She acknowledges that no one will forgive her, but offers an explanation: ""It [her life] was death. I chose life."" When Julia spontaneously hugs her, she looks stunned and surprised, then moved by the demonstration of compassion.', ""The film picks up after the second films events and reveals Jake  has been placed in a mental asylum after the events of the second film under the care of Dr. Sullivan, his caretaker. One day, Dr. Sullivan leaves Jake locked in his room, as he tried to escape several times, and Jake begs Dr. Sullivan to stay and keep him company but leaves anyway and while alone in his room, Kayako grabs Jake and pushes him against the wall several times. Sullivan is quickly called by an officer, and she watches the footage, wondering what he is doing to himself . As they race to his room, they find him dead, with every bone broken in his body. The news of Jake's death reaches a young woman in Tokyo, Naoko. Naoko, who is the sister of Kayako, is mocked by her co-workers because of her sister. She finds the print paper  of Jake's death pasted on her monitor at her desk office, and believes her sister caused the death. She decides to go to the apartment building to stop the spread of the curse once and for all, and asks her husband Daisuke to travel to Chicago, who agrees. Meanwhile, the apartment building is in the middle of renovations in an effort to draw in new tenants. The landlord as specified in the movie is Max and his two sisters, Lisa, and 8-year old Rose, a woman named Renee along with her daughter Brenda, including an old woman artist named Gretchen, who are the few tenants who remained in the building. Max is on the verge of being fired from his job, while dealing with Rose's breathing condition and Lisa moving to New York with her boyfriend Andy. Lisa doesn't believe Rose when she tells her that she has seen a dead boy running around the building and Rose even left him a gift which is Mr. Potato Head, the toy then mysteriously disapears. Because of the Kimble family murders, an old woman named Renee moves out of the apartment with her frightened daughter Brenda though Max tries to convince her to stay, she insists on leaving, Mr. Praski who is Max's boss takes notice and threatens to fire Max but Max convinces him to give him another chance and even informs him of the new tenant moving in , meanwhile at their new home, Renee and Brenda are settling in to their new home and while Renee is unpacking, Brenda proceeds to take a bath, while she is bathing the evil spirit of Takeo Saeki drowns her in the bathtub, Renee soon walks in and discovers her daughter missing. Eventually, Naoko moves into the building, now sure that it contains the curse. Lisa finds Dr. Sullivan taking photos of Jake's old apartment. She explains that Jake has died and that he told her stories of a woman with long black hair and dead white skin, along with a little boy that killed the rest of his family, which she believes to be a fantasy Jake made up because he couldn't deal with the facts. She also mentions that he had hallucinations about her and the boy, but this time the hallucination broke every bone in his body. Lisa confirms that her sister has also seen the same little boy, making Dr. Sullivan finally believe that Jake's delusions were true. The next day, Dr. Sullivan leaves with Lisa after Jake's funeral and goes back to her office, where she tells her a story about the Saeki family, the family Jake described in his  hallucinations. Back in the apartment Gretchen is seen painting a portrait of Rose in her room with classical music on, and while washing her paintbrushes in her sink she hears a noise in her room and encounters a can of red paint spilled on the floor and Gretchen's painting shredded up, she picks up the portrait and it quickly flashes Kayako's face, Gretchen drops it in horror and the red paint starts to make handprints and Kayako crawls out of another painting and crawls over to Gretchen who is backing up in horror and eventually gouges out her eyes and rips off her jaw. Meanwhile, while walking in the park Naoko explains her and Kayako's life story to Lisa and tells her that the curse now resides in the apartment and she tries to convince Lisa and Rose to participate in an exorcism to rid the building of the evil spirits. Lisa initially refuses to cooperate, being worried about Rose and herself, and leaves Naoko in the park.

As she enters her home, her mother Nandita  tells her that her father Shekhar  has sent her a letter and wants to meet her as he’s dying from illness. Sheena refuses to meet her father, as he abandoned her & her mother for sixteen years when Sheena was just six years of age. As her mother persuades her to meet him, she finally agrees to pay her father a visit and she sees him in a bad situation under careful nursing. Unable to express his feelings, Shekhar lends his daughter a diary in which he wrote about all the incidents that led to his break-off. Henceforth, the story of Dr. Shekhar unspools. Sixteen years back, the world of Shekhar and Nandita with their little daughter was nearer to perfection so much that no one could suspect that in his complacent heart was lying the seed of betrayal. Shekhar's life takes a U-turn as he meets an actress and a former beauty queen, Kavya Krishna , at a hospital with her wrist being slit and slowly the two fall for each other and continue to meet even after her wrist is cured. Shekhar's friend, Dr. Kunal Mehta , then confronts him to stay away from this woman as he feels that their constant interaction will cause damage to Shekhar's marital life. A week later, Shekhar goes to Goa for a press conference and Kavya follows him there and tells him she had no choice other than this to break her feeling of loneliness. Something brews between the two as Shekhar goes back to his home in Mumbai. Soon enough, Nandita notices that Shekhar is uncomfortable with the surroundings and as she tries to help him he starts yelling at her about why she is giving him so much importance in her life. Further problems take place as Shekhar misses his daughter's annual school function, and then he decides to confront Kavya and asks her to end this relationship. But Kavya leaves no stone unturned, she goes and visits him at his office at the hospital and in tears asks him to forget all what he said yesterday and explains to him how she can feel happy only with him. Shekhar then hugs her and explains to her how much he loves her back. Back at home, Nandita tells Shekhar that a journalist from Mid-Day newspaper had called and wanted to speak to him. Ignoring this call, the next day Shekhar discovers that his relationship with Kavya is printed in the newspaper and has become the talk of the town. Kunal's wife Shilpa  then spots Nandita at a restaurant and shows her the newspaper, leaving her in complete shock. Later, Shekhar arrives at home as he and Nandita confront each other about the affair as the confrontation ends with Nandita giving him a slap on the face. The next day, Shekhar finds Nandita sitting at his office as she apologizes to him for what happened the previous night and tells him about how she wants both of them to fix what's been broken and how she will do anything just to save this marriage from breaking. She later visits Kavya's house to confront her and asks her to let her family live in peace. As Shekhar is informed about Nandita's visit to Kavya, he loses his temper and decides to leave the house telling Nandita how he regrets his marriage. The next day, Sheena's parents are called to her school to pick her up as she's sick while the principal tells them how he's upset with the recent change in Sheena's behavior at school. Sheena then tells her father that her classmates have been picking on her after his affair with the star, but he denies it when she asks him whether it’s true or not. Later that day, Kavya's manager  asks her to stop making her personal life public as her reputation is being ruined. Kavya then gets angry, blaming Nandita for what's happened and she fires her manager thinking he is working against her. She then asks Shekhar to make a choice between her and Nandita as wouldn't mind risking her own life to keep her man exclusively for herself. Torn between the two women, Shekhar decides to split from his wife and his daughter and chooses Kavya over his family not knowing that he would regret this choice forever. Shekhar then gets a call from Nandita, telling him that he should pay his daughter a visit as she's sick. Kavya refuses to let him go and tells him this is Nandita's plan to take him back. Shekhar gets furious and yells at her saying she is mad, lonely, and mentally ill. Kavya is hurt, so she grabs a gun, and shoots herself. Shekhar goes back to Nandita asking her for forgiveness, but she turns him down. After reading all this, Sheena goes back to her father and hugs him as he apologizes to her saying that he feels hurt because he has not been a good father.

Sheena cries to her mother asking her to forgive him too and she finally agrees to forgive him."", 'The film opens with the introduction of the central characters. Dr. Satyajit Chavan is the chief of medicine at a government hospital in Mumbai. In the opening sequence, he is informs a patient  that the patient is certain to die very soon. He proceeds to ask  the patient\'s relatives to remove the patient from the hospital immediately so as to save money and free up bed space. Satyajit is well regarded and respected, but has terrible bedside manners and is generally rude to everyone. His staff of doctors, most of whom are young interns fresh out of medical school, inquire about his bedside manner. He curtly informs them that his job is to treat patients, and that beds must be allocated to the ones who are most likely to survive and get better. We discover that government hospitals  are severely limited in bed space and attract the worst stricken patients in the city. These draconian conditions have shaped Satyajit and his views on treatment. Sarbajeet ""Saby"" Singh and Kashmira Singh are a young Punjabi couple; they are about to marry. In a departure from the arranged marriages, they have chosen each other independently. They invite their parents to a joint dinner and inform them of their choice. The parents are cheerful to oblige, and gladly arrange the wedding ceremony. Once married, however, Saby and Kashmira discover their varying interests and aspirations. The main conflict is around cricket: Saby is a great fan of cricket and Kashmira does not care very much for the sport. Saby watches every India match with unfailing religious zeal. Kashmira however is left alone and unattended, and gradually feels abandoned and unloved. Hemendra ""Hemu"" Patel is a janitor working at London airport. He represents the journey of a poor immigrant. His main goal is to secure British citizenship so that he can return to India with great ceremony . He deals with the cultural differences of his UK-inclined teenage daughter. His wife Priya is affectionate and supportive, and though she does not share his obsequious quest for British citizenship, she generally encourages him to achieve his goals. David Abraham, affectionately called ""Chinaman"" by fans, is a celebrated Indian cricketer. He has retired from active international cricket, but is frequently invited to games , functions and sporting events as the guest of honor. The film presents various crises in these peoples\' lives. The theme that underlies these people and their crises is cricket. David Abraham injures himself while at a celebrity cricket match, and is admitted to the government hospital.  Satyajit is the attending physician. There is an inevitable conflict of personalities. David is happy and cheerful about life, even when he knows he may die. The hospital doctors and staff, invariably cricket fans, warm to him, and reinforces his love of the game. Satyajit remains grumpy and aloof, and is simply unable to understand why a game means so much to a man who is about to die. A pointed conflict arises when David requests a television set be installed in his room so he can watch the upcoming world cup finals. Satyajit refuses. David cheerfully informs him that he will get his TV set and that he will bring Satyajit to smile before David\'s time is up. David has an upcoming kidney transplant operation. He pleads with Satyajit to have the operation after the finals, but Satyajit rudely refuses, saying he may die if it is delayed further. David secures a small AM radio so he can follow the tournament, but Satyajit eventually discovers and confiscates it. David, however, is undeterred in his love of life and of cricket, and Satyajit grows angrier still. Hemu attends his first citizenship interview. The interviewing officer turns out to be a narrow-minded racist who berates Hemu  and urges him to return to India. Some time after, the officer and Hemu find themselves at a sports bar. Hemu cheers boisterously when England loses a wicket . The officer notices this and subsequently denies Hemu\'s initial application. Hemu pleads desperately with the officer, but the officer stands firm. Hemu is devastated. Hemu is hurt further when he discovers his teenage daughter getting cozy with an African student named Silver. He becomes violent and confrontational, and eventually alienates his daughter. His wife Priya remains loyal to him, but now strongly disapproves of his behavior. Saby and Kashmira continue having trouble with their marriage because of Saby\'s obsession with cricket. On the advice of a girlfriend, Kashmira takes to watching cricket with Saby but with her attentions on the handsome cricketers. She inadvertently blurts out their names while intimate with Saby. Saby becomes furious and begins to lose his interest in the game. Removed from his passion, Saby deteriorates and alienates himself from Kashmira. He visits his parents and discusses his intentions to split from Kashmira. The crises are resolved within the frame of cricket. The resolution of three crises forms the ""hat trick"". David confronts Satyajit and asks why Satyajit is so detached from life even when Satyajit has a successful career and a happy family. Satyajit is forced to examine himself. He discovers how he chose to stay in India in spite of the opportunities to venture abroad. He was never happy with this choice, and thus took to being harsh and rude with everyone. He discovers that people love David because David is full of joy, and people simply do not wish to deal with his  rudeness. He decides to change, and tries to find happiness in the smaller things in life. He is not able to postpone David\'s surgery, but makes up by screening the world cup finals on a large screen for David. Priya confronts Hemu. She points out how Hemu disparages the racial attitudes of the British, but is himself similarly disposed towards Silver. She indicates that he is willing to don the Union Jack merely to obtain citizenship, and asks how he expects others to be happy for him when he is unhappy and confused about himself. Hemu examines himself and decides to change for the better. He is informed that his application for citizenship has been approved, and returns home to a warm reception with his family, friends and the original interviewing officer in attendance. He decides to welcome Silver to event as well. Saby\'s parents confront him. They point out that he has ignored Kashmira in his zealous enthusiasm for cricket. How will she be able to love him when he is not able to understand her needs? He finally understands this, and returns to Kashmira with a renewed zest for making her happy. They are reunited. The film ends with the principal characters returning to their lives with happiness.', 'Radha  is a 19 year old poor girl living in a one-room shanty with her handicapped and bed-ridden father Sadhu Ram . She is reduced to begging for providing food for the two of them and is hounded almost daily by Bhiku Chacha , the right hand man of their shanty\'s owner Manohar , who is a rich and unscrupulous businessman as they owe almost one hundred and fifty rupees in rent for over a year to him.One day whilst begging she meets the young and charming Nirmal Chander  who chastises her for begging and hands her a visiting card of his friend who he informs her is a kind man and will provide her with work.In fact, Nirmal himself is the owner of a textile mill and the contact he provides Radha with is that of his factory manager.

She goes to Manohar to beg for some more time and mercy but he overcome with lust at the sight of the helpless young girl, traps her in his room and forcibly rapes her, and then lets her know that he forgives all the amount they owe him in return. She is heartbroken and ashamed and comes home a mental wreck unable to confide in either her father or Nirmal. She stops going to work, starts distancing herself from her suitor and roams around alone till the point when she becomes sick and faints and a neighbourhood woman checks her to reveal to her father that she is quite a few months pregnant. Her father is shocked and passes away in grief to hear this. Radha,being the traditional Bharatiya Naari, goes to commit suicide from a cliff because clearly abortion is immoral and confiding in her rich.modern boyfriend doesn\'t even come to her traditional head filled with shame and guilt. However, here she meets the happy go lucky chap Mast Ram ([[Agha  who talks her into giving up the idea of suicide and takes her to live with him in his house,which he calls the Mast Mahal. It is a self-created ancient piece of architectural wonder that is supported by the bare trunk of a tree at a precarious angle and has stumps of felled trees in place of chairs and tables.Mast Ram himself is an orphan and a product of sex outside marriage, hence much chastised by society is the diametrically opposite of Radha.He seems genuinely happy to be alive, have four working limbs and is a man easily pleased with two square meals a day, or sometimes even not, and always has a song or two on his lips. He takes to Radha like an elder brother and it is in his house, her son Chandu is born. Mast Ram advises Radha to give up her infant son to an orphanage run by a Swami Ji for the betterment of the both of them but Radha vehemently refuses, and decides to work and struggle to bring up her son, as he is all she has left now. She goes back to her old place of work and this time ends up finding out the owner of the mill to be Nirmal. He is angry and rude to her for running out on him earlier without any explanation and insults her. But afterwards, he has a change of heart and follows her to Mast Mahal where he finds out about the infant. Radha tells him everything honestly and angry and embarrassed at himself, he goes up to Manohar and beats him up in his frustration. Afterwards, he offers marriage to Radha once again as he truly believes that whatever happened was not due to any fault of hers and that she has suffered enough. Nirmal is a modern, educated and charming man and Radha accepts his proposal but has apprehensions about how his mother will take to her, considering she has such a scandalous event in her past. Nirmal tells her that in time his mother will accept the situation and love her as much as he does, and it is in the best of all their interest to hide the presence of her son from his mother now. He arranges for her son and Mast Ram to live in a mansion owned by his father and now vacant alongside an ayah for the infant.

She follows Radha one day, arrives on her breast feeding the child, and Radha in fear of being caught red handed tells her that the child is not Nirmal\'s. She thinks that Radha has duped her son and therefore ruined the social standing and prestige of her family and throws her out of her house.Radha writes a letter to Nirmal for him to return quickly, and in his harrowed sense of mind,he rash drives and crashes his car to turn over a bridge into the sea. With the news of Nirmal\'s death,Radha is beyond grief and goes to his mother, who still refuses to accept her.Also seeking his chance now, Manohar offers Radha the proposition of becoming his kept with her child, and tries to force himself upon her.

It turns out to be an emergency signal and the two friends together with Plåt-Niklas and The Parrot set out on an expedition to resque whoever is sending the signal. While crossing a stream, though, Froggy Ball falls down a small waterfall and ends up in a dark cave. While looking for a way out he stumbles upon the Cone People who live there and quickly befriends the Cone King and Queen. In the meantime Charlie Strap has met up with Kottegrön, a young and impulsive female cone, and soon joins Froggy Ball and the others. It turns out that the Cone People are the ones who have been sending the signal, and when elevated up to a tree top Charlie Strap and Froggy Ball see a helicopter landing, with three evil businessmen from the company Tonto-Turbo who are planning to tear down a huge part of the forest. When the businessmen leave, Kottegrön ends up being with them on the helicopter.  Charlie Strap and Froggy Ball hang on to the landing skids, but eventually fall off high up in the air over a lake. Luckily it turns out that Carlie's tailcoat can be used as a parachute, and Froggy Ball even learns how to steer it by pulling the tails so they can land on a steam boat. On the boat Plåt-Niklas and The Parrot succeed to locate them so they can join them again. The boat takes them to Gripsholm Castle, which turns out to be where the businessmen were heading too, as their full plan is to move the old castle to the cleared space in the forest and turn it into a hyper modern luxury hotel, replacing most of its walls and floors with glass. This will be made possible by hacking the authorities' computers with a special program they are keeping on a floppy disk. Kottegrön, who has been hiding in a briefcase, tries to steal the disk but fails. Instead she, Charlie Strap and Froggy Ball end up on the bottom of the castle well, but are soon resqued by Plåt-Niklas who has the ability to fly. In the meantime the men from Tonto-Turbo leave again in their helicopter. Plåt-Niklas calculates that they are heading to the city, before he flies back to the cone forest with Kottegrön. In the city, Charlie Strap and Froggy Ball walk up to Tonto-Turbo's central office and confront them, but are simply laughed at and disregarded. The businessmen then head off to the Nobel party where they have been invited. The two friends, left in the office, discover that the men forgot to bring the floppy disk with them. They try to find out which one of the disks at the office it is that is the real one, and while trying one in the computer the frog ends up inside of a computer game and Charlie has to control him into safety with the joystick. Soon after that, one of the men returns - and takes the right disk with him. Unable to get into the Nobel party, Froggy Ball is ready to give up when a submarine appears. Out of it come Plåt-Niklas and Kottegrön who have returned. Through the kitchen they smuggle themselves into the party by hiding in the dessert - an ice cream parade. When inside Froggy Ball holds a speech where he accuses the men from Tonto-Turbo in public. The atmosphere becomes confused, and the men capture the two friends and decide to get rid of them once and for all. But then suddenly The Fox, who had previously only been seen in a short cameo in the very beginning of the story, arrives and causes disruption. While the men are distracted everybody can escape, and Kottegrön steals the floppy disk. After a wild chase though, the men recapture the disk, but only to see an army of cones arrive and chase them into the water, where also the disk is dropped by The Parrot. Back in the cone forest the frog is awarded a prize from the hands of the cone Minister of Flower Pots and the businessmen are given a new profession - shaving sheep, which they seem to enjoy."", '{{Plot}} The cartoon opens on a golf course. As the camera pans across the course, we see Tom trying to hit a ball out of a giant divot, and finally hits the ball out on his 50th attempt. When Tom takes the flag out of the hole, the ball promptly drops itself in...and quickly bounces out. Tom is surprised by this, and lifts the green, rolling the ball into the hole. When the ball is thrown out again, he putts. After it is thrown out again, the cat shoves the ball into the hole and pounds the end of his club in after it, and the ball promptly whacks into the cat\'s eye. It is then revealed that Jerry lives in the hole on the golf course, and he was the one throwing the ball out. Jerry looks at Tom and draws an eyeball on the golf ball, which enrages the cat and causes him to swing at the mouse; his club misses and wraps around Tom\'s own neck. Jerry escapes temporarily, but is caught when Tom hits his golf ball onto Jerry\'s head, knocking him silly. The next scene shows that Jerry is being used as a tee and Tom places a ball on his head. Tom then readies his shot, which cuts out a huge divot while Jerry simply held onto Tom\'s club and the ball. Tom looks far off into the distance to see where his ball is, but Jerry whistles and holds up the ball. Tom then puts Jerry through the ball cleaner, and the mouse responds by spitting soapy water in Tom\'s face. Jerry is then forced into holding the tee with the ball on it; Tom hits the ball and poses with his teeth showing, which proves to be a mistake when the ball hits a huge boulder and bounces directly back the way it came, and it shatters all his teeth above and all his teeth beneath. In the next scene, Tom\'s ball is in front of two skinny, long trees. Tom cannot stand behind his ball to hit it, so he is forced to split the trees to hit his ball. The trees smash his head, apparently decapitating him, and Tom\'s body walks around and stands directly under it, somehow reattaching the head to the body. The ball ends up in a tree and triggers a ""slot machine"" display on the trunk. Three lemons appear on the reels, so Tom peeks inside the trunk, and an avalanche of golf balls comes out of the tree, tripping the cat. Annoyed at this, Tom returns to his game, but Jerry has replaced his ball with a woodpecker egg. After Tom hits the egg, the egg hatches and the bird comes back to peck on Tom\'s head, pecking out the blade of the golf club such that the head lands on Tom\'s head. Tom tries to hit another ball, but Jerry has hollowed it out such that it goes nowhere. Tom then places the shell on the chuckling Jerry\'s head and swings at the ball-mouse, which lands right next to the hole. Jerry, with the ball still on his head, dizzily prances around the hole, and Tom pokes him in after making sure that nobody is looking. Tom then takes out his scorecard and tries to figure out his score for the hole. He writes down 3 in his card , but Jerry scolds him and Tom writes 33 instead. When Tom tees off on the next hole, Jerry ties the club to Tom\'s tail; Tom ends up flying into the hole, leaving only his head exposed. Jerry sets up a putt and hits the ball toward Tom\'s mouth, then whacks the cat on the head, forcing Tom to scream in pain and swallow the ball. Jerry runs away and the incensed cat emerges from the hole, but continually runs into his own clubs. Tom then swings a ball toward Jerry with some English on it, which scoops up the mouse and brings him back to Tom. Tom swings, which sends a tiny divot with ball and mouse through the air. Jerry uses the divot like a B-52 and drops the golf ball towards Tom like a bomb. Tom digs a trench to protect himself, but the ball opens to reveal a smaller black ball, which explodes. Meanwhile, Jerry\'s divot crashes into a tree which Tom pokes at with the club; in response, the mouse grabs the club and pokes back. Tom then climbs into the tree and Jerry spanks the cat with the club, which causes the cat to peek out at the other end of the tree where a beehive is hanging. The bumblebees swarm around Tom\'s head, and he slowly realizes the situation, dives into and out of the tree, and hides in a bush. Jerry, not to be denied the pleasure of humiliating the cat, runs the bush over with a lawn mower revealing Tom shaved like a French Poodle. The bumblebees then chase Tom over a lake hazard, where a stick of bamboo is seen; Tom hides under the water and is using the stick of bamboo like a snorkel, so he can hide underwater where the bumblebees cannot reach him. Jerry then whistles to get the bumblebees\' attention, turns a \'150 yds.\' sign around to say Guess Who? and points it at the bamboo stalk. The queen bee looks through the bamboo stick to see Tom, who spits water in her face. Enraged,the queen leads the swarm on a bombing run down the stick. Jerry then places a funnel on top of the bumblebees to assist them in dive-bombing through the stick and into Tom\'s mouth. The water is shown for a few seconds, with a drum roll playing, and then all the water flies into the sky for a moment. Tom jumps out and lets out a frightening and loud scream. Jerry then takes a driver and hits a long drive, which hits Tom square on the head from a far distance, knocking him out. Repeated in Mouse Cleaning.', 'A woman named Helen , who works at the zoo, tells her boss Mr. Sutten  that she doesn\'t think it\'s right for the animals to be trapped there, she argues that they should live in houses like humans. After a failed attempt at disposing of her with a trapdoor, Mr. Sutten gives her three animals, Mark the Polar Bear , Paul the Alligator , and Warren the Ostrich , and makes a deal - If she can take them home and prove they are able to conventionally live in a house like the average human, he will shut down the zoo and release them all. Helen takes the animals back to her apartment for the night and leaves them with a manual on how to live there, telling them she\'ll check up on them again in the morning. The animals first find her washing machine and dryer, which Mark goes into assuming it\'s where he is supposed to bathe when the others question what it\'s for. When he comes out, he feels dizzy from the spinning and bumps into a shelf, knocking a bottle of floor wax onto the ground, causing the slippery wax to then spill across the floor and prevent them from being able to get up. Somebody then appears at the door, and upon trying to get over and answer it the three animals find they slip over every time. Mark tries to resolve the problem by kicking Paul and Warren across the room, but this causes disaster when they crash straight through the door and knock the man down the stairs. At the bottom the man tells them he had come to offer them spiritual enlightenment, which Paul declines, claiming he heard it\'s ""high in sodium"". Later, Mark takes some ice from the fridge and puts it on his bed in an attempt to make it feel more like his bed at home. During the night, however, all the ice below him melts and floods the apartment, as well as waking up the others. The water then reacts with an electrical outlet, causing a fire. In attempt to stop the fire, Paul checks Helen\'s manual, which tells them in the case of a fire the apartment\'s sprinkler system will start automatically. The sprinkler then turns on, which resolves the fire but contributes to the flood. Now desperately trying to work out how to prevent the flood from getting even worse, Paul reads aloud that the sprinkler system will turn off manually, but he misunderstands the meaning of the word, asking ""Where are we supposed to find a man at this hour?"" Warren suggests that if they wait, the sprinkler system may just turn off by itself... The next morning Helen arrives back at the apartment, seeing water flowing out from underneath the door as she arrives. When she opens it, much to her dismay a huge gush comes out and washes her away, after which she finds her apartment in a huge mess. Helen asks the animals ""What on Earth happened?"" with Paul responding ""We had a little accident"", although Warren attempts to lighten the situation by reassuring her that they ""kept the place intact"". This is soon proved wrong when Mark leans against the wall, his hand going straight through it and consequently causing the entire building to collapse. The cartoon ends with a disappointed Helen breaking the fourth wall, saying ""This is going to be tougher than I thought"".']"

It is Stanley\'s stark vision of a young life in the 90\'s inspired by Marillion\'s album of the same name, which centres around a teenage girl who is found wandering in a state of amnesia on the Severn Bridge, and her consequent search for her past. Although this story bears similarities to actual recorded incidents in the history of the Severn Bridge we wish to stress that this is a work of fiction. On the bottom of the cover, the following lines can be read: ""Watch it loud with the lights off.""', ""The film opens with a foreword: There are important fragments of life that have been avoided by the motion picture because Thought is concerned and not the Body. A thought can create and destroy nations&mdash;and it is all the more powerful because it is born of suffering, lives in silence, and dies when it has done its work. Our aim has been to photograph a thought&mdash;A thought that guides humans who crawl close to the earth&mdash;whose lives are simple&mdash;who begin nowhere and end nowhere. The &#34;humans who crawl close to the earth&#34; are then introduced one by one. The Boy is a homeless, unemployed youth who fancies The Girl. He is a failure, the intertitles explain, because he believes in failure. According to The Boy, there are two types of people in the world—the poor, helpless &#34;children of the mud&#34; and the rich, successful &#34;children of the sun&#34;—and he places himself somewhere in the middle. The Boy and The Girl live near a harbor and struggle to find food; eventually, they have to leave for the city: not only The Boy is unable to find a job, but also The Brute has been harassing The Girl, and The Boy is afraid of a direct confrontation. They leave, taking with them The Child, an orphan who lost his parents to an accident and was also a victim of The Brute. In the city The Girl catches the attention of The Gentleman. He offers the three protagonists lodgings and promises to find a job for The Boy. His real plan is, however, to not help The Boy and wait until The Girl has no other choice but to offer herself to him in exchange for money. The Boy does fail in his job search, but The Girl is reluctant to become a prostitute; at some point, The Gentleman decides to take the whole company to the country to &#34;let romance do a little work.&#34; He does that, but when he tries to seduce The Girl, The Boy finally finds courage to stand up for her. The Boy beats The Gentleman up and leaves together with The Girl and The Child; the intertitles proclaim that now that The Boy is no longer afraid and believes in himself, he belongs to the children of the sun: It isn't conditions, nor is it environment&mdash;our faith controls our lives! The film ends with The Boy, The Girl and The Child walking towards the sunset."", 'The plot-summaries of the shorts are listed below in the order that they run in the DVD release, which is not the chronological order. Chronologically, the order would be: *The Second Renaissance - a prequel set generations before the original film, The Matrix, relating how humans built artificially intelligent Machines, the apocalyptic war between the two, ending with the Machines enslaving the human race and the initial creation of The Matrix virtual reality. *A Detective Story - a stand-alone story in which the character Trinity appears, but independently of any other characters. Because Trinity is present it takes place at least within several years of the films, and though it is not made clear within the cartoon if it takes place before or after Trinity met Neo in the original film, another official source places it before the events of The Matrix.Matrix Universe poster, included in Enter the Matrix: Official Strategy Guide, Bradygames, 2003. *Kid\'s Story - set during the six month gap between the events of the first and second films, after Neo joins the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar in freeing other humans from the Matrix. Its events are briefly alluded to in dialogue at the beginning of The Matrix Reloaded. *Final Flight of the Osiris - takes place directly before The Matrix Reloaded, as the hovercraft Osiris stumbles upon the Sentinel army digging to Zion. At the beginning of The Matrix Reloaded, Niobe mentions that their reconnaissance photos of the Machine army were transmitted from the Osiris. The other four shorts  are independent of the events of any other installment. While they generically deal with the virtual reality of the Matrix, and the Zion rebels, conceivably they could take place at any point in the generations-long struggle between the human rebels and the Machines running the Matrix. Like the Matrix trilogy, the entire movie except The Final Flight of the Osiris was rated R by the MPAA mainly for its Sci-Fi violence. When it was released on DVD, it was unrated.  The Second Renaissance is a two-part film written and directed by Mahiro Maeda. He used Bits and Pieces of Information written by the The Wachowskis as a prequel to the series as a base for the first part. With increasing numbers of people released from all labor, the human population has become lazy, arrogant, and corrupt. Despite this, the machines were content with serving humanity and, as the narrator states, ""for a time, it [the status quo] was good"". This phrase is a reference to one of the most famous phrases of Genesis, consistent with the Biblical references seen throughout the original Matrix films, and is one of numerous references to Genesis in particular present in ""Second Renaissance"". The relationship between humans and machines changes in the year 2090, when a domestic android is threatened by its owner. The android, named B1-66ER in what appears to be a reference to the character Bigger Thomas from the novel Native Son, then kills the owner, his pets, and a mechanic instructed to deactivate the robot. This murder is the first incident of an artificially intelligent machine killing a human. B1-66ER is arrested and put on trial, but justifies the crime as self-defense, stating that it ""simply did not want to die"". During the trial scene, there is a voice-over of Clarence Darrow  quoting a famous line from the Dred Scott v. Sandford case in 1856 in his closing statement, which implicitly ruled that African Americans were not entitled to citizenship under United States law. Using this as a precedent, the prosecution argues that machines are not entitled to the same rights as human beings, and specifically that human beings have a right to destroy their property, while the defense urges the listener not to repeat history, and to judge B1-66ER as a human and not a machine . {{quote}} B1-66ER loses the court case and is destroyed. Across the industrialized world, mass civil disturbances erupt when robots and their human sympathizers rise in protest. World leaders fear a robot rebellion, and governments across the planet initiate a major program to destroy all humanoid machines. News reports show rioting in American and Western European cities such as Chicago and Berlin, alongside the peaceful ""Million Machine March"" on the Albany district courthouse where B1-66ER was sentenced. Visual references are made to such incidents as General Nguyễn Ngọc Loan\'s execution of Viet Cong officer Nguyễn Văn Lém, the Tank Man standoff following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, the Al-Aqsa Intifada and The Holocaust. Some robots escape destruction when humans, in their greed, still want the robots to work and produce things for them. The machine population is exiled, and they create their own nation in the Middle East, named Zero One . According to the narrator, the robots built Zero One in ""the cradle of human civilization"", an allusion to the Fertile Crescent, apparently located in Saudi Arabia\'s ""Empty Quarter"" which is devoid of human life. Essentially ghettoized at Zero One, the machines establish their own industrial base there and begin to produce efficient, highly advanced artificial intelligence, echoing Vernor Vinge\'s thoughts on a technological singularity. The new nation excels at manufacturing high-tech consumer products, and before long, Zero One\'s consistent export of cheap, reliable, mass-produced goods begin to undercut the global economy. The United Nations Security Council calls an emergency economic summit at UN headquarters in New York City, resulting in UN delegates approving of a global economic blockade of Zero One that echoes the Cuban Missile Crisis. Two robotic ambassadors, built as a mechanical Adam and Eve, are sent by the leaders of Zero One to peacefully request the admission of their state to the United Nations as a prelude to settling the economic crisis peacefully. Despite their peaceful intentions, the ambassadors are forcibly removed from the chamber, and their application is rejected. As this scene unfolds, the narrator states that ""this was not the last time the machines would take the floor there"" foreshadowing the end of Part II. Part I ends as the Security Council debates the issue of short-sightedly declaring war on the Machine Empire.  Part II opens with United Nations aircraft unleashing a massive nuclear bombardment on Zero One. The nuclear carpet bombing devastates the machine city, but is unsuccessful in destroying many elements of the mechanical population, given that the machines did not have the same weaknesses to the bombs\' fallout and heat as humans. The machines retaliate by unleashing their armies to conquer neighboring human countries, triggering a world war between the United Nations and Zero One. Unfortunately, most of the world\'s industrial output is already based in Zero One, as the lazy humans had grown accustomed to not producing things for themselves. Despite their best efforts, human troops are unable to hold back Zero One\'s relentlessly efficient onslaught, and slowly retreat . As the machine forces push deeper across the planet, military leaders begin to pursue increasingly desperate solutions. At a summit of political and military leaders from around the world, unanimous approval is given to a plan code-named ""Operation Dark Storm"", which aims to cut the machines off from the sun, their primary energy source. The plan is executed in 2095, with high altitude bombers dispersing sky-darkening nanomachines into the air, while the human armies simultaneously launch a ground offensive against the machine forces. The plan is initially successful, although many of the human nations\' long-range weapons systems are also disabled by the lack of sunlight. With their high-tech weapons rendered useless, human commanders are forced to launch close-quarters infantry engagements, supported by electromagnetic artillery fire and armored assaults using atomic tanks and powered armor. Heavy losses are taken on both sides, but the Machines gradually gain the upper hand. Legions of a new model of machine, no longer in humanoid form and appearing more like the insectoid or cephalopod-like Sentinels and others of the Matrix films, overrun the human armies. This coincides with the destruction of original man-made robots at the hands of human forces and, as a result, the further dehumanization of the rapidly emerging machine collective. As the machine armies swarm across the human defenses, the United Nations, in desperation, fires nuclear missiles directly at the machine armies, vaporizing their own troops in the process. To make up for the lack of solar power, the machines begin capturing human prisoners and using their bodies to power large biomechanical tanks, which quickly cut through the dwindling human artillery. As the expanding armies of Zero One overrun Eurasia, they unleash lethal biological weapons which further ravage humanity. Eventually brought to its knees by the might of the machine army, the Security Council calls a global summit at U.N. headquarters to sign an armistice and end the war. Zero One\'s machine ambassador signs the peace treaty with a barcode, in which the humans agree to surrender their remaining territories to the machines. ""Your flesh is a relic, a mere vessel. Hand over your flesh and a new world awaits you. We demand it"" are the only words the machine utters before it detonates a nuclear bomb in the meeting chamber, killing most of the planet\'s leaders and destroying New York City, one of the few remaining human settlements. In 2102, the machines crush the leaderless remnants of the human armies, and the war ends. Zero One is victorious, but it is a Pyrrhic victory: the planet has been devastated by the war and by the crippling ecological impact of the Dark Storm shroud, which the machines are unable to remove. In need of a new energy source, the machines adapt their bioelectric tank technology to build vast human-stocked power stations, using their bodies\' waste-energy to catalyze a powerful fusion reaction, in which in its making the Humans endure many days of agonising torture, and at its completion, the Machines create the computer-generated virtual reality of the Matrix , to keep their prisoners sedated by feeding the virtual world into the prisoners\' brains, starting with the first prototype Matrix .  Kid\'s Story was written by the The Wachowskis and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, with animations by Kazuto Nakazawa and production design by Studio 4°C, Tokyo. It is the only one of the animated shorts contained in The Animatrix in which Neo appears. The short takes place during the six month gap between The Matrix and The Matrix: Reloaded, during which time Neo has joined the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar and is helping the rebels to free other humans from the Matrix. Kid  is a disaffected teenager who feels there is something wrong with the world, frequenting hacker chatrooms on the internet and wondering if he is alone. In school, he absent-mindendly scribbles ""Neo lives"" in his notebook. One day he receives a personal invitation from Neo  to escape the Matrix . The following day, he receives a call from Neo on his cell phone, and is chased through his high school by a band of Agents, before ultimately being cornered on the roof. He asserts his faith in Neo, and throws himself from the roof, whereupon the other characters are shown holding his funeral. The short fades up from black as the Kid awakens in the real world to see Neo and Trinity watching over him. They remark that he has achieved ""self substantiation"" , which was considered impossible. In both the short itself and The Matrix Reloaded, however, the Kid seems to believe it was Neo\'s actions, not his own, that saved him. Self-substantiation is never thoroughly discussed in any part of the series. Morpheus speaks of the founder of Zion who freed himself, presumably without external help. However, this was revealed to be a ruse by the machines. Kid\'s Story and World Record both heavily hint at this as the viewer wonders how a man being awoken from one of those pods, apparently helpless, could somehow build and start a city.  Program was written and directed by Yoshiaki Kawajiri. The character designs were done by Yutaka Minowa. In case with Beyond and Matriculated it is also a midquel of the first or second film. It follows the protagonist, ""Cis"" , who is engaged in her ""favorite simulation"": a battle program set in feudal Japan. After successfully eliminating an attacking enemy cavalry, a lone samurai appears whom Cis recognizes as ""Duo"" . ""Cis"" made her first appearance as an image in The Matrix Revisited. Initially, the two duel as allies, testing one another\'s fighting abilities. During the course of their duel, Duo briefly disarms Cis. He questions her concentration and wonders whether she regrets taking the Red Pill that took them out of the ""peaceful life of the virtual world"". They continue fighting until she finally overpowers Duo and is poised for the \'kill\'. It is at this point that Duo states that he has ""something to say"". She sarcastically assumes that he wants to propose [marriage]; but instead he admits a desire to return to the Matrix; incredulous, Cis nevertheless responds that doing so is impossible as \'the truth\' is already known to them, forbidding their re-integration. Duo reasons that reality is harsh and that he is tired of it. He adds that the Machines can make the both of them forget the truth. Duo then states that he has disabled or killed the other crewmembers and contacted the Machines. He asks Cis to return with him to the Matrix, but she continues to refuse. As Duo becomes more aggressive in his arguments for returning, Cis attempts to escape while simultaneously warding off his attacks. Becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the situation, Cis requests an operator in order to exit the simulation. Duo tells her that no one can hear her and reiterates that it ""is already done...[the machines] are on their way"". Thereafter their fighting becomes much more serious and forceful as they move from rooftop to rooftop. Duo, in a flying leap, attacks her from above with his sword. As the blade comes towards her, Cis, standing her ground, concentrates and halts its forward motion inches from her face and breaks it. She takes the broken end of the blade and thrusts it into Duo. Duo states his love for her as he dies. Suddenly, she wakes from the program and discovers that the encounter with Duo was a test program devised for training purposes. A man named ""Kaiser""  unsuccessfully assures her that she acted appropriately during the test and met the test\'s targets. Clearly upset, she punches him in the face and walks away. He remarks that ""aside from that last part"", she passed the test.  World Record was created by Madhouse and directed by Takeshi Koike, with a screenplay by Yoshiaki Kawajiri and is also a midquel of the first or second film. The beginning of this short includes a short narration from the Instructor  explaining details behind the discovery of the Matrix by ""plugged-in"" humans. Only exceptional humans tend to become aware of the Matrix, who have ""a rare degree of intuition, sensitivity, and a questioning nature"", all qualities which are used to identify inconsistencies in the Matrix. This is not without exceptions, given that ""Some attain this wisdom through wholly different means."" The story is about Dan Davis, a track athlete, who\'s competing in the 100m in the Summer Olympic Games. He has set a world record time of 8.99 seconds, but his subsequent gold medal was revoked for drug use. He decides to compete again and break his own record to ""prove them wrong."" Despite support from his father and a young reporter, Dan\'s trainer tells him that he is physically unfit to race and that pushing himself too hard will cause a career ending injury. Dan is adamant on racing. On the day of the race, he is monitored by 4 agents located in the stadium. The race begins and Dan starts off strong. However, the muscles in his leg violently rupture, putting him at a setback and scaring many of the people in the stands. Through strong willpower, Dan ignores the injury and runs much faster than he did before, easily passing the other athletes. Before he can cross the finish line, 3 of the agents possess the 3 closest runners and try and stop him, but even they can\'t catch up to him. Dan\'s massive burst of energy in the Matrix causes his real-world counterpart  to rip apart the plug connecting him to the Matrix, causing him to see the real world through his pod. A Sentinel restrains him back in his pod and violently shocks him with electrified restraints. Dan\'s mind is thrown back into the Matrix, but his body is exhausted from the race and what he has just seen, causing him to tumble to the ground at high speeds. Despite this, Dan easily won the race and broke his original time of 8.99 seconds with a time of 8.72 seconds. The next scene shows a crippled Dan being wheeled by a nurse through a hospital. A nearby agent calls his other agents to tell them that they erased Dan\'s memory of the race and that he will never walk again; he won\'t be an issue. However, Dan quietly whispers the word, ""Free,"" angering the agent and telling him to sit back down. Davis then breaks free of the restraints in his wheelchair and takes a few steps before falling down again and being helped up by the nurse.  Beyond is written and directed by Koji Morimoto. It is a midquel short film, during the first or second installment of the trilogy. It follows a teenage girl, Yoko , looking for her cat Yuki. While asking around the neighborhood, indicatively somewhere in Japan, she meets some younger boys. One of them tells her Yuki is inside a ""haunted house"" and invites her to see it. The children have stumbled across an amalgamation of anomalies within an old, dilapidated building. They have learned to exploit this glitch in the Matrix for their own enjoyment, through several areas which seem to defy real-world physics: glass bottles reassemble after being shattered, rain falls from a sunny sky, broken lightbulbs flicker briefly , a door which opens into an endless dark void, shadows which do not align with their physical origins, and a dove\'s feather that rotates rapidly in place in mid-air. There is a large open space in the middle of the run-down building where they take turns jumping off a high point and falling towards the ground, yet somehow stopping inches before impact. This proves amusing and they do not seem to be bothered by the inherent strangeness of the place. Throughout the film, brief sequences show that Agents are aware of the problem in the Matrix, and a truck is seen driving toward the site to presumably deal with the problem. It arrives while the children are still playing, and an Agent-led team of ""rodent exterminators"" moves in to clear everybody out of it. The story ends when Yoko and the others return to the area the next day and find the site has been turned into an unremarkable parking lot. They unsuccessfully attempt to re-create the bizarre occurrences of yesterday and soon go in search of something else to do.  A Detective Story is written and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, with animation by Kazuto Nakazawa and is a direct prequel to the first film. It follows the story of a down-on-his-luck private detective, Ash , on what he calls the ""case to end all cases"". Ash receives an anonymous phone call to search for a hacker that goes by the alias ""Trinity"" . Ash traces Trinity and learns that other detectives have failed in the same task before him; one had committed suicide, one had gone missing, and one had gone insane. He then attempts to speak with the insane detective but cannot get anything substantial out of him. This detective is an African American with a thin mustache who shows a resemblance to Walter Mosley\'s detective character \'Ezekiel ""Easy"" Rawlins\'. This is a possible homage to the character as Mosley\'s detective series is set in a similar Noir type setting and there were not many black detectives at the time. Eventually Ash finds Trinity after deducing that he should communicate using phrases and facts from Lewis Carroll\'s Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland. She proposes a meeting, and he successfully finds the location. At the meeting she removes a ""bug"" from his eye, planted by Agents earlier in an ""eye exam dream"". Agents appear and attempt to apprehend Trinity in a shoot-out with her and Ash. While the two fugitives are trying to escape the train, an Agent attempts to take over Ash\'s body, forcing Trinity to shoot him in order to prevent the Agent from appearing. Ash is wounded, whereupon he and Trinity bid farewells without malice. Trinity escapes, telling Ash that she thinks he could have handled the truth. Agents enter the car to find Ash, who points his gun at them while looking in the other direction and lighting a cigarette. The Agents turn to Ash who, even though he is armed, will likely die. With this apparent no-win situation, the film ends with Ash\'s line  as his lighter flame goes out.Easy Rawlins  {{Redirect}} Matriculated was written and directed by Korean American director Peter Chung, widely known for his work on Aeon Flux. Like Beyond, it is a midquel of the first or second film. The film deals with a group of above-ground human rebels who lure hostile intelligent machines to their laboratory in order to capture them and insert them into a ""matrix"" of their own design. Within this matrix, the humans attempt to teach the captured machines some of the positive traits of humanity, primarily compassion and empathy. The ultimate goal of this project is to help the intelligent machines develop free will in order to overcome their original ""search-and-destroy"" programming, rather than reprogramming it by force. The rebels\' hope is that, once converted of its own volition , an ""enlightened"" machine will assist Zion in its struggle against the machine-controlled totalitarianism which currently dominates the Earth. After capturing one of the ""runner"" robots, the rebels insert the machine into their matrix. The experience of the robot leads it to believe it may have a relationship with one of the female rebels, Alexa , either friendship or something deeper. However, the rebel group is attacked by the Machines and unplug themselves to defend their headquarters, but they experience what might be considered a Pyrrhic Victory: all the onscreen rebels are killed but the single robot captured in the film successfully \'reprogrammed\', indicated by the machine\'s mechanical eye changing from red to green. The robot plugs the dying Alexa into their matrix with itself, the only two things left surviving. Much to the machine\'s dismay, when the rebel realizes she is trapped inside the matrix with the ""friendly"" robot, she turns horrified and her avatar dissolves screaming as she clutches her head, and the robot exits from the rebels\' matrix to see a motionless Alexa in front of him in the real world. The film ends with the \'converted\' robot standing outside the headquarters of the human rebels, with a light on its back now turned back to the color red.  Final Flight of the Osiris was written by the The Wachowskis and directed by Andy Jones, with CG-animation production and design by Square Pictures, this segment is rated PG-13 by the MPAA for ""Sci-Fi Violence, Sensuality and Language"". The short is a direct prequel leading into the events of The Matrix Reloaded. Thadeus , a muscular man and an athletic woman called Jue  engage in a blindfolded sword fight in a virtual-reality dojo. With each slice of their swords, they remove another piece of each other\'s clothing. Immediately after cutting the other down to their underwear, they lift their blindfold to peek at the other. As the two are about to kiss, they are interrupted by an alarm and the virtual reality simulation ends. In the next scene, the hovercraft Osiris is headed for Junction 21 when Robbie , the operator, picks up thousands of Sentinels on his HR scans. The ship flees into an uncharted tunnel, where it encounters another group of Sentinels patrolling the area. The crewmembers man the guns onboard and destroy the patrol. The ship then emerges on the surface, four kilometers directly above Zion and close to the army of Sentinels previously detected in the scan. Alerted to the Osiris\'s presence, the army of Sentinels pursue the ship. Captain Thadeus decides Zion must be warned, and his shipmate Jue volunteers to broadcast herself into the Matrix to deliver the warning while the ship is doggedly pursued. Jue and Thadeus admit to peeking at each other in the VR simulation. Entering the Matrix on a high rooftop, Jue jumps off and acrobatically makes her way down through structure work between two buildings. When she hits the ground in the alley below, a ripple effect is created by her impact. She drops off a package into a mail box. The package sets the prologue for Enter the Matrix. She attempts to contact Thadeus via a cell phone as the Osiris are overcome by Sentinels and crash. The Sentinels tear their way into the ship. At the time of the call, Thadeus is making a last stand to hold off the Sentinels. Shortly after Jue says ""Thadeus"" over her cell phone, the Osiris explodes, destroying many of the pursuing Sentinels. In the Matrix, Jue falls to the ground, dead, her body having been destroyed on the ship.']"

Xu Fugui  is a local rich man\'s son and compulsive gambler, who loses his family property to a man named Long\'er . His behaviour also causes his long-suffering wife Jiazhen  to leave him, along with their daughter, Fengxia and their unborn son, Youqing. After he loses his entire family fortune, Fugui eventually reunites with his wife and children, but is forced to start a shadow puppet troupe with a partner named Chunsheng , using puppets donated by Long\'er to support his family. The Chinese Civil War is occurring at the time, and both Fugui and Chunsheng are conscripted into the Kuomintang during a performance. Eventually Fugui is able to return home and explain his absence, only to find out that Fengxia has become mute and lost most of her hearing due to a fever. It is revealed that Long\'er did not want to donate any of his wealth to the ""people\'s government"", and when they tried to pressure him to do so, they only enraged him further so that he decided to burn all of his property instead of giving it away. He was designated an anti-revolutionary reactionary and executed. Fugui realizes the serendipity of losing their fortune to Long\'er, for he could have been executed had he not lost it in their bet. The ending of this decade shows Fugui and Jiazhen locating the certificate Fugui earned after fighting in the war in the wash. It is symbolic of their family for the certificate is fragile, much like the family, and the two try to carefully unfold it so they can hang it in their house to show that they are a revolutionary family despite their past wealth. The story moves forward a decade into the future, to the time of the Great Leap Forward. The local town chief enlists everyone to donate all scrap iron in their possession, including cookware, to the national drive to produce steel and make weaponry for retaking Taiwan. As an entertainer, Fugui performs for the entire town, and so is allowed to keep the small pins that hold his puppets together. The town, which has been devoted entirely to producing steel, also establishes a communal kitchen for everyone to get food from. Soon after, some boys have begun picking on Fengxia, who cannot fight back or tell anyone since she cannot speak. Youqing, who adores his older sister, decides to get back at one of the boys by dumping a huge bowl of noodles and chili sauce onto his head at the public kitchen. In the fury afterward, one man accuses Youqing, and by default, Fugui, of trying to sabotage the kitchens. Since Youqing will not apologize, Fugui begins to paddle him. Later, when they have returned home, Fugui learns of the reasons of his son\'s actions, and tries to apologize, only to be rebuffed. That night, when he is giving another shadow play to the workers, he asks Jiazhen to convince Youqing to come see it, as a way to make it better between them. In the end, Youqing does come, and with a bowl of tea for his father. But only because his mother has given him the idea of putting vinegar and chili sauce in it, as well as helped him, as a way of payback. In the end, Fugui ends up ragingly and eventually playfully chasing his son around the smelting area. The mother\'s actions also made it look like the child was just a prankster, and possibly to make the people no longer think Youqing\'s actions was sabotage set up by Fugui. One day a while later, while Fengxia and Youqing are sleeping, several of Youqing\'s classmates come by to tell him that they have to go to school now, since the District Chief is coming. Still sleepy, Fugui carries him there, despite his wife wishing to let him sleep, since he has not been able to sleep well in weeks. Tragically, the boy falls asleep against a wall, which the District Chief\'s truck accidentally knocks over, killing Youqing. At the grave site of the boy, his mother leaves for him a lunchbox of 20 stale dumplings, which were intended as his lunch for school that day, plus 20 newly made dumplings. The District Chief visits the family at the grave, only to be revealed as Chunsheng. His attempts to apologize and compensate the family are rejected, with Jiazhen declaring that he owed them a life. The story moves forward again another decade, to the Cultural Revolution. The village chief advises Fugui\'s family to burn their shadow puppet drama props, which have been deemed as counter-revolutionary as they are representative of traditional Chinese culture. Fengxia is now grown up. Her family arranges for her to meet Wan Erxi, a local leader of the Red Guards who also has a disability. They fall in love and soon marry, and Fengxia becomes pregnant. It is revealed that Chunsheng, the district chief, has been branded a reactionary and a capitalist. Throughout the years, Fugui had forgiven Chunsheng, but Jiazhen does not want to see him. He arrives late at night to inform Fugui and Jiazhen that his wife has committed suicide and implies that he plans to do so also as he was unable to cope with both losing his wife and killing Youqing. Chunsheng gives Fugui the bank certificate for all of his money as a form of his final apology and wished that they accept the money before his death. Fugui refuses to take it, and Jiazhen, who up to that point had refused to talk to Chunsheng, reconciles with him and encouragingly tells him to keep living, because ""You still owe us a life!"" Months later, during Fengxia\'s childbirth, her parents and husband accompany her to the county hospital, where they find out that young medical students are in charge. Since all doctors have been sent to do hard labor for being ""reactionary academic authorities"", the students are left as the only ones in charge, despite being so young. The nurses tell the family that both the child and mother will be fine, but the family is skeptical. Wan Erxi manages to retrieve a doctor from confinement to oversee the birth. As the doctor has not eaten for several days, Fugui purchases seven steamed buns  for him. Fugui and Jiazhen decides to name the son Mantou, after the buns, or at least until he is born. Soon, a healthy baby boy is born, and everything seems to have gone perfectly. However, Fengxia begins to hemorrhage, and the nurses panic, admitting that they do not know what to do. The family and nurses seek the advice of the doctor, but find that he has overeaten and is semiconscious. The family is helpless, and Fengxia bleeds to death. Her parents decide to keep the baby\'s name as Mantou, or ""little bun"". The movie ends six years later, with the family now consisting of Fugui, Jiazhen, their son-in-law Erxi, and grandson Mantou. The family visits the graves of Youqing and Fengxia, where Jiazhen, as per tradition, leaves dumplings for her son. Erxi buys a box full of young chicks for his son, which they decide to keep in the chest formerly used for the shadow puppet props. When Mantou inquires how long it will take for the chicks to grow up, Fugui\'s response is a more tempered version of something he said earlier in the film, that the chickens would grow into geese, which would grow into sheep, which would grow into oxen. However, in spite of all of his personal hardships, he expresses optimism for his grandson\'s future, and the film ends with his statement, ""and life will get better and better""  as the whole family sits down to eat.', 'The film\'s protagonist is a North Korean refugee named Seung-Chul struggling to adjust to life in Seoul. He is sharing a small apartment with a fellow defector named Kyung-chul, a ""broker"" who helps refugees send remittances to their families in North Korea . While both face difficult circumstances in recovering from trauma and adjusting to a new life, Seong-chul and Kyung-chol react to their situations quite differently. Seong-chul is extremely shy and submissive to authority. Throughout the film he\'s portrayed as a diligent worker, doing thankless tasks and accepting criticism stoically. Kyung-chul, by contest, has few moral scruples, attempting to steal a pair of pants and taunting Seong-chul. At the start of the film Seung-chul has a job pasting advertisements for sex shops throughout his neighborhood; he is repeatedly beaten up by thugs. Seeking more stable employment he applies for other jobs but is rejected when employers see his citizen registration number, which marks him as a North Korean defector. Finally he gets a night job at a karaoke bar; the bar owner\'s daughter, it turns out, is a woman named Young-sook who he recognizes from church. However, she asks him to pretend not to know her at church, because she\'s ashamed of working at a karaoke bar and doesn\'t want members of her congregation to look down on her; Seung-chul agrees not to say anything. Later in the film, when there are no customers at the bar, some of the female employees hear him singing church hymns as he works; after laughing at him for being out of tune, they offer to teach him to sing. However, when Young-sook walks in, she is angry and demands an explanation, asking why he would sing church hymns with karaoke girls. He tells her he doesn\'t know any songs other than hymns- the implication is that he doesn\'t know South Korean pop songs and it would be frowned upon to sing North Korean songs. Not realizing he\'s a defector, she assumes he is lying, and fires him. The climax occurs at a prayer meeting which Seung-Chul attends with Detective Park, the police officer assigned to help him adjust to life in South Korea. Up till now, viewers have known he is a defector only due to the numbers on his ID card; now they learn the details of his story. Born in Musan, in impoverished North Hamgyong province- he became severely malnourished and got in a fight with a friend over food. The next day he saw his friend lying on the ground, exactly where they had been fighting the day before; Seung-chul realized he was dead, and assumed the fight had killed him. He became wracked with guilt; the pastor assures him that God will forgive him. After the prayer meeting, however, Detective Park berates Seung-Chul, asking why he told his story and saying ""Who would want to be friends with a killer?"" Seung-chul tells him he doesn\'t have any friends, and walks out of the church; as he\'s leaving, Young-sook, who was at the prayer meeting and heard his story, comes up to him and apologizes, explaining she ""had no idea"" he was a defector. She also offers him his job back at the karaoke bar and says she wants to be his friend; he walks away without answering. Returning to his apartment, he finds his dog, Baek-gu, missing; while he was gone, Kyung-chul had attempted to sell it, but was told no one would buy it because it was a half-breed; he then abandoned it in the middle of a busy street. Seung-chul goes to look for the dog and finds it eating out of a garbage bag. The next night, Kyung-chul apologizes- and asks Seong-chul to retrieve the money he\'s hidden in Baek-gu\'s doghouse, reassuring him that its ""honest money""; he then reveals his plan to go to America. Seung-chul agrees to help him, but says their friendship is over and ""this will be my last favor."" Entering his apartment that night, Seung-chul is assaulted and beaten by Kyung-chul\'s clients, who demand to know where he is so they can force him to pay them back. Seung-chul refuses to tell them. The next morning, he goes to church, where Young-sook invites him to join her in the choir; he agrees. That night, while working at the karaoke bar, he leaves his dog Baeuk-gu outside to wait, because his apartment is no longer safe; somehow Baek-gu gets off his leash, and during a break, Seong-chul finds his body in the street, run over by a car. vLnPZGJk7_U]', 'Ju Yeong-jak  is a successful lawyer who works long hours. While he is working, his wife Eun Ho-jeong , who gave up her dancing career in order to be ""A Good Lawyer\'s Wife"", raises their young adopted son and works as a dance instructor in the local gym. Ju Yeong-jak\'s father, Chang-geun , an alcoholic with a fatal liver failure, has not slept with his wife in 15 years. She is having an affair with another man, and when Chang-geun finally dies, she tells Yeong-jak and Ho-jeong about her relationship with the other man—an old friend from her grade school—and says that she even plans to marry him. Her daughter-in-law Ho-jeong supports her. Ho-jeong herself cannot achieve an orgasm from Yeong-jak. But for reasons that are not made clear in the English subtitles, he is not satisfied by her either and is having an affair with a young woman, who is an artist and a former model . He receives from the young woman the satisfaction he lacks at home. When Ho-jeong catches her teenager neighbour  peeping on her undressing in her apartment, she is, at first, angered. But she then decides to fulfil his peeping wish and allows him to see her doing nude gymnastics through the window. He then follows her on his bike and even barges into her dance class. She eventually follows him to the cinema where they talk. As they watch a movie, she teases him by acting oblivious to him groping her breasts. Meanwhile, Yeong-jak runs a drunk motor cyclist off the road while receiving a blowjob from his young mistress. Yeong-jak takes the man to a hospital but drops off his girlfriend on the way; his primary concern is that the presence of his girlfriend not become public knowledge. Due to the other driver\'s reputation as a quarrelsome eccentric alcoholic, the authorities assume that the other driver is entirely responsible for the crash. Yeong-jak promises the man, a postman who needs to be able to drive to keep his job, that if the postman does not mention that there was a woman in the car he will use his legal connections to make sure that the man does not suffer any consequences for having been driving while drunk. One evening, after she Ho-jeon finally learns about her husband\'s affair, she tells her teenage neighbour to follow her without giving any details except suggestively saying ""I hope you\'ll be okay."" She takes him to the abandoned dance hall. Without exchanging a word, she just allows him to mount her, but he soon stops and rolls aside . Not giving up, she fellates him. She then mounts him herself while at the same time giving him a handjob, moving in spasms and moaning loudly as she finally gains her long sought orgasm. The father of Ho-jeong\'s teenager neighbour soon finds out about their affair and exposes it to Yeong-jak, unaware that Yeong-jak apparently does not care what his wife does. However, Yeong-jak fails to keep his promise to the postman. The postman kidnaps Yeong-jak\'s adopted son and throws him off a building to his death. The postman then commits suicide. Yeong-jak and Ho-jeong are devastated by their son\'s death. Ho-jeong blames Yeong-jak for starting the chain of circumstances that ended with the murder/suicide. The story ends on an enigmatic note. Ho-jeong discovers than she is pregnant and knows that Yeong-jak cannot be the father. He offers to accept the child as his own but she informs him that he is ""out of the picture."" It is unclear from the final scene if Yeong-jak is hurt or relieved by her announcement. The story also addresses the legacy of the Korean War and its impact on many families. Yeong-jak\'s father and grandfather escaped from the communist north—apparently during the war. Yeong-jak\'s grandmother and his father\'s sisters remained in the north and ""perished"". Yeong-jak\'s father is last seen in the final stages of dementia singing a communist anthem honoring North Korean leader Kim Il-sung. Yeong-jak goes out into the country to inform his grandfather of the death and discovers that his grandfather has been dead for six months, and that his grandfather\'s young female companion had not notified the other members of the family. There is also a subplot about the excavation of a mass grave containing the remains of Korean civilians who were killed—apparently by the communists—during the Korean War.']"

At the same time, the Warsaw Pact are aggressively expanding their sphere of influence. In addition, the Ukrainian wheat harvest fails and a communist coup occurs in Mexico. On a September morning in the small town of Calumet, Colorado, a local high school teacher pauses mid sentence when he sees paratroopers landing in a nearby field. These are Russian Airborne Troops, who promptly open fire when the teacher confronts them. Pandemonium follows as students flee amid heavy gunfire. In downtown Calumet, Cuban and Soviet troops are trying to impose order after a hasty occupation. Shortly thereafter, Colonel Bella  instructs the KGB to go to the local sporting goods store and obtain the records of the store\'s gun sales on the ATF\'s Form 4473, which includes the names of citizens who have purchased firearms. Jed Eckert, his brother Matt, and their friends Robert, Danny, Daryl, and Aardvark, flee into the wilderness after hastily equipping themselves at Robert\'s father\'s sporting goods store. While on the way to the mountains, they run into a Russian blockade, but are saved by a US Army helicopter gunship that destroys the blockade. After several weeks in the forest, they sneak back into town; Jed and Matt learn that their father has been captured and is being held in a re-education camp. They visit the site and speak to him through the fence; Mr. Eckert orders his sons to abandon him, and to ""avenge"" his inevitable death. They then visit the Masons and learn that they are behind enemy lines in ""Occupied America""  and that Robert\'s father has been executed because the guns from his store - the ones he gave to the boys - were found to be missing by the occupation authorities. The couple also charge the boys with taking care of their two granddaughters, Toni and Erica. After killing some Soviet soldiers in the woods, the youths begin an armed resistance against the occupation forces calling themselves ""Wolverines"" after their high school mascot. Initially the occupation forces try reprisal tactics, executing groups of civilians following every Wolverine attack, in hopes of intimidating the local population and compelling the Wolverines to surrender or desist from further attacks. During one of these executions the Eckert brothers\' father is killed. Daryl\'s father, Calumet\'s Mayor Bates , tries to appease the occupation authorities. The teenagers find a downed United States Air Force F-15 pilot, Lt. Col. Andrew Tanner and learn about the current state of the war: several cities such as Washington, D.C., Kansas City, and Omaha have been obliterated, America\'s Strategic Air Command has been crippled in a surprise attack by Cuban saboteurs who had posed as immigrants illegally crossing the US-Mexico border, and the paratroopers the youths have encountered were dropped from fake commercial airliners to seize key positions in preparation for subsequent massive assaults via Mexico and Alaska. The middle third of the US has been taken over, but American counterattacks have halted Soviet progress and the lines have stabilized. Concerned about nuclear fallout, both sides refrain from the further use of nuclear weapons. Tanner then assists the Wolverines in organizing raids against the Soviets. Soon after, in a visit to the front line, Tanner and Aardvark are killed in a battle between a US and two Soviet tanks. As a result of the escalating attacks, Soviet commanders now view the Wolverines as a serious threat. Using threats of torture, KGB officers force Daryl to swallow a tracking device, then release him to rejoin the guerrillas. Spetsnaz are sent into the mountains following these signals, but are ambushed and killed by the Wolverines. The group discovers that their pursuers are carrying portable radio triangulation equipment and trace the source of the signal to their friend. Daryl confesses and pleads for mercy but is coldly executed by Robert after Jed executes a Soviet soldier captured during the battle. The Wolverines\' morale erodes as the war of attrition takes its toll. The remaining members are ambushed by three helicopter gunships after being baited by a truck dropping supplies on the road, and Robert and Toni are killed, leaving the group reduced to four. Determined to save at least some of their number, Jed and Matt attack the Soviet headquarters in Calumet to distract the troops while Danny and Erica escape to liberated territory. The plan works as Danny and Erica escape, while Jed and Matt are wounded. Though Colonel Bella encounters the brothers, he cannot bring himself to kill them and lets them go. Still, it is implied that the brothers die in the park where the two spent time as kids. The film\'s epilogue is narrated by Erica and suggests that the United States repelled the invasion some time later. A plaque is displayed with ""Partisan Rock"" in the background, which has been a recurring motif throughout the film as each dead comrade\'s name has been inscribed upon it. The plaque reads:  ...In the early days of World War III, guerrillas - mostly children - placed the names of their lost upon this rock. They fought here alone and gave up their lives, so that this nation shall not perish from the earth.', 'August 2, 1990, at dawn in Kuwait, a long succession of tanks and trucks drive toward and over the TV screen as opening credits roll, with contemporary radio news report playing. Guy Hunter, Jr., Steven Shaefer, Steve Tate, Beverly Clark, Phoebe Jeter, Jonathan Alston, Ben Pennington, Mary Rhoads, Devon Jones and Lawrence Slade are introduced to the viewer, mostly in the context of family and friends back home, while Iraq invades Kuwait, Kuwaitis resist the invasion, Saddam Hussein takes foreign nationals in Iraq prisoner as human shields, the United States progressively increases its forces in and around Saudi Arabia, Army Reserve units become activated for Desert Shield, the United Nations sets a deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, and finally, Saddam Hussein ignores that deadline up to the first commercial break. The activations mean that Ben Pennington does not get to tell his father and brother, who are off in the woods, goodbye, Phoebe Jeter does not get to see her ill grandmother for one last time, Daniel Maldonado misses the birth of his daughter, and one bride, Linda Buckholz, has to show her wedding to the guests on video. The viewer is treated to displays of American and coalition military deployment as contemporary radio news reports inform the viewer that the United Nations coalition has started to attack Iraq and occupied Kuwait as a prelude to liberating Kuwait. As Ben Pennington is deployed aboard an Air Force rescue helicopter, a hidden cameraman interviews him, and Ben replies that they are deliberately attracting Iraqi radar so AH-64 Apache helicopters can target the radars with anti-radiation missiles to clear a corridor for the bombers and simultaneously providing rescue cover in case a pilot is shot down and needs to be rescued by Ben and the crew on board. The viewer gets to hear more news reports about infrared and night vision technology and laser-guided missiles fired from planes including the F-117 Nighthawk while a Nighthawk is displayed and gun camera footage shows various targets being destroyed in a sterile, precise fashion. Another news report mentions the role played by the Navy battleships Wisconsin and Missouri while they are shown firing their {{convert|16|in|mm|0|sing8AX3Nw9Ivos&feature=related 4:11 to 5:05, ""I\'ve met Iraqi pilots, and they\'re good..."" but attributed their weaknesses to Iraqi command and control, when, once it and the radars were defeated, made the Iraqis easier to shoot down. Back home in Pennsylvania, Beverly Clark is dismayed to be activated and deployed, and shares her doubts about coming home alive with her mother. Several starving and frightened Iraqi soldiers, waving white flags and approaching the border, surrender to Crumes\' and Ford\'s Marine squad, and cringe when the Marines fire a warning shot. The prisoners are given food and medical attention as required under the Geneva Convention. In contrast, Iraq\'s treatment of coalition prisoners such as British TornadoDiscovery Channel Video, On The Inside, episode, Inside the Kill Box, narrated by Michael Ironside, released January 15, 2001.

The F-14 Devon Jones is flying is hit by a surface-to-air missile despite attempts to evade it, and both are forced to eject before the jet is engulfed in flame. Devon Jones lands in Iraq before dawn and activates his emergency transmitter. Soon Ben Pennington is out looking for him. But the Iraqis are also homing in on the rescue signal. Devon notices a truck, and then notices the Air Force helicopter. The helicopter notices the vehicle, and Devon indicates it might be a military vehicle. At least one AH-64 Apache is covering the rescue, and fires Hellfire missiles on the truck. Ben expertly disembarks from the helicopter, rifle drawn, and quickly finds Devon, does a ""fireman\'s carry"" for him, runs to the MH-53J helicopter, hands over his rifle, hands over Devon, and quickly secures Devon for liftoff while gunners watch for the enemy. Not a second after Devon is secured when the helicopter lifts off, ""inbound"" with ""survivor on board"". Devon demands to know about his backseater, Larry. Ben replies that they will know when they return to base. Indeed, Larry was captured. Crumes and Ford are enjoying some bottled water when the Battle of Khafji begins and a unit needs a Corpsman. Crumes is able to save one soldier\'s life, but reflects to Ford on the terror of war and asks if Vietnam was as bad. Ford replies that the all-volunteer U.S. military in Iraq is better trained than the U.S. military in Vietnam, but adds that the Marines will still go in first, this time like the last. After another news report and video of Scuds falling on Israel, which although attacked, must remain neutral for the sake of maintaining the international coalition including Egypt and Syria, the Patriot anti-missile system is introduced. Phoebe Jeter\'s battery saves Gary Buckholz\'s base. Meanwhile, Beverly Clark and Mary Rhoads are at a processing center for incoming U.S. soldiers, in Dhahran, which will later be hit by a Scud. Meanwhile, Private Steven Shaefer has volunteered for Desert Storm duty, and quickly upon arriving in Kuwait meets Specialist Jonathan Alston. When an explosion is heard in the distance, Alston knows that Shaefer is inexperienced in combat, and questions him about his training. Sure enough, Steven has not been prepped on chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear warfare or even on land mines, merely his basic training. When Jonathan demands to know how the Army messed up sending him into danger, Steven drops his bombshell. Alston is impressed and says they will win medals like Alston\'s uncles did in the Second World War. The ground war starts.

Precision weapons save their unit when the enemy is ""danger close"". Shupp orders his men only to fire in self-defense after the enemy surrenders. Indeed, another news reporter voices over video of long lines of Iraqi prisoners of war who had been forced to fight with death squads and land mines to prevent desertion. Guy Hunter, Jr., gets tortured again after a coalition strike that scares him, and probably did more than scare his captors. Threatened with execution and blindfolded, Hunter shows no fear, and says ""just do it."" Meanwhile, Beverly Clark is winning at trivia, but pauses long enough to get a soda and chat with her best friend Mary Rhoads. Beverly tells Mary she has come to peace about being deployed in a danger zone, and Mary invites Beverly to join her for fresh air, though Beverly declines. Suddenly there is a Scud alarm. Mary starts putting on chemical warfare gear, and Beverly instructs others to do the same. However, the Patriot is not successful in annihilating the Scud, and Mary watches in horror as Beverly and her comrades are hit by the incoming warhead. Another news reporter voice-over with video of the aftermath. It is not long before the Clarks in Pennsylvania are summoned to Army Reserve headquarters, where a tactful notification of families is under way, but taking too long for the Clark parents. Beverly\'s mother found out what her husband, weeping in the senior officer\'s office, already heard from him, and despite her initial denial, she understands the truth. Alston and Shaefer get their medals when they volunteer to kill an Iraqi suicide squad ready to detonate an ammunition dump in the way of U.S. forces in Objective Utah, western Kuwait, and overcome various dangers including land mines and trip wires. Shaefer distracts the squad with his M-16 while Alston, above the trench, tosses in a hand grenade. The Basra-Kuwait ""Highway of Death"" is depicted next with more videos and voice-overs, indicating that the intent is not to destroy, but to disable the Iraqi retreat. Nevertheless, in contrast to the funeral of Beverly Clark in Pennsylvania, a significant amount of death exists on the Highway for a U.S. Army chaplain, announced by the newscaster as a rabbi, to provide appropriate Muslim rights for. By now, Hunter has been reunited with other American POWs, including Larry Slade: when one hugs Hunter, it is evident the Iraqis broke his ribs. When the Iraqis come back, they come back with cheap perfume. Hunter challenges the captors, and enraged, one threatens to shoot him, but Hunter is not going to give them the satisfaction of showing fear this time either. He replies, ""God bless America."" The U.S. troops return home to widespread jubilation, including one Linda Buckholz in her wedding gown. The celebration contrasts with Phoebe Jeter at the grave site of her grandmother. Finally, President George Herbert Walker Bush gives an address celebrating the defeat of aggression and the restoration of Kuwait to its people.', ""{{Plot}} GP: Guard Post is on the frontline inside the Demilitarized Zone . The tour of duty lasts for 3 months and nobody is allowed to leave. A maze-like concrete bunker is approximately 990-1650m2. Soldiers are fully armed and ready to engage at all times. Guard Posts are a vestige of the Cold War. The date is May 29, 2007, 8.03pm. A group of soldiers from the military police  break into one of the guard posts, numbered GP 506. They search from room to room, looking for something. Eventually, they enter a large, dark room and notice numerous bloodstains awash on the floor and walls. One of the MP soldiers hit something on the floor and find a corpse. The rest of the soldiers spot someone under their torch lights, to reveal a half-naked blood-drenched man breathing heavily, and holding a large axe. The man starts to laugh, and the MP soldiers move in to disarm and put him into custody. At the same time, Sergeant Major Seong-gyu Noh, along with a friend in the army, are paying their last respects to Noh's wife. Later, in their car, Noh’s friend informs him of an assignment that the military has ordered him to do: head to Guard Post 506 to investigate a strange incident there. Noh learns that the guard post is headed by the army chief’s son, 1st Lieutenant Jeong-u Yoo. His friend warns him that this assignment may very well cost him his job, if he’s not careful in handling the situation. He continues by telling Noh that all the soldiers at GP 506 were killed except for one , who’s currently in a coma, and that he’s the only suspect. Noh has until 6.00am to investigate the cause before more soldiers from HQ will come and clean up everything. Noh arrives at GP 506 about an hour later. On the way to the office, he passes a boiler room that has words written in blood on the wall, which says: “Kill all of them.” He is brought to the recreation room where the bodies were found, and watches in shock at the amount of blood splattered around the room. Noh is brought to the unidentified man at the beginning, who is comatose. The MPs are going to bring him to a military hospital. Noh arrives in the guard post office, where he meets 1st Lt. Bang, the one in charge of bringing the soldiers here, and the medic, only known as Doc. He tells both of them that he will be assuming command of this investigation from this point onward. Heading back to the recreation room, Noh starts searching for clues, and finds a battered birthday cake in blood. He finds a soldier’s dog tag inside it. Comparing the name incripted on the tag to the lockers, he identifies the comatose man, who is Corporal Jin-won Kang. Later, he and a soldier, Sergeant Yoon, comb through the maze-like tunnels that make up the bunker. Doc, who is preparing the bodies to be shipped to a military coroner, calls Noh’s attention to an apparently missing soldier. The 19 bodies they found and Cpl Kang, do not tally with the 21 soldiers who are stationed at GP 506. Noh wants Doc to check again, only to reconfirm 19 bodies. Noh then allows Doc and a group of soldiers to transport the bodies and Kang away from the GP. Meanwhile, 2 MPs are struggling with the guard dogs stationed there. The guard dogs has gone fierce and will not allow the MPs to handle them. One of the dogs bite a soldier in the arm. Flashback: Private Cho, one of the soldiers at GP 506, is sent by his superior at night to check up on the guard dog’s incessant barking. Cho followed the noise of the dog’s barking into a small alley, only to find the noise ceased. Cho called the dog’s name and rounded the corner, only to witness in shock at one of his superiors, Sergeant Ma, his face drenched in blood, who is busily biting the dog to death. In the present, Noh checks the guard post’s records and notices that someone has been controlling the weapons lately. All personal weapons were kept in the armory and not in the barracks, which was unusual. One of the soldiers reports to Noh, informing him that they have found another survivor, inside the generator room. Noh manages to disarm the man, who is wielding a knife. Later, the man eats hungrily at food given to him by the MPs, as Noh questions him. The man says he is 1st Lt. Yoo, the son of the army chief and the head of GP 506. However, he refuses to say anything more, insisting on the MPs sending him back to base HQ. Noh reports to his superior on the phone, who wants him to bring Yoo back, despite his objections as the investigation has not been completed yet and will be forced to end once the clean up crew arrives in the morning. Noh refuses to listen anymore to his superior and ends the call. He then goes off to look for Yoo at the canteen, only to find he’s not there. One of the MPs tells him that he went to wear his uniform. Noh immediately rushes to the office, to find Yoo tearing pages off his own journal. Noh pulls him off and puts him back in custody at the generator room. However, he finally decides to let Yoo leave GP 506 and puts him in a jeep with another soldier. Sergeant Yoon finds a video-cam stashed inside the food storage room. Noh reviews the contents. It shows the soldiers of 506 celebrating someone’s birthday, and suddenly the recording is written over, to show Cpl. Kang. With strangely determined eyes, he announces his intention to kill all his mates in the platoon and he has to end this himself. However, the recording fizzles and Noh is unable to see more. Meanwhile, Doc and the group of soldiers transporting the bodies are blocked by a landslide and have to turn back. Flashback: Cpl. Kang brings some of his men to the machine-gun at the top of the guard post and fools around, accidentally causing the gun to fire and the North Korean soldiers stationed 300 meters to fire back. After this, Cpl. Kang and the rest of the platoon are punished, with Kang himself having to do chores for the rest. In the present, Noh reads Kang’s personal records that he was a troublemaker, but he thinks that Kang doesn’t look like one who would go insane and embark on a killing spree. He pores over Yoo’s journal. Flashback: Yoo questioned one of his sergeants on the disappearance of Sergeant Ma and his men, who went out into the woods one day and gone missing, only to stagger back to 506 looking sick. Private Kim found Ma drooling at his post, and Ma walked eerily towards him. In his fear, Kim ran and fell down the stairs injured. However, he did not remember exactly what happened. Kim, Ma and his men had the same symptoms, scars on their bodies, having no memory what happened to them. As Yoo decided to lock up Ma and his men, one of the soldiers informed him that Kim was found dead with inflicted wounds all over his body. The rest were shaken over Kim’s death. Cpl. Kang went on sentry and overheard Yoo assuring HQ on the phone that everything was fine. In the present, Doc returns with the bodies and Cpl. Kang lapses into critical condition. Despite Doc’s attempts to resuscitate him, Kang dies. Later, the jeep containing Yoo returns and he refuses to leave the vehicle, banging his head on the window. Noh drags him out and back to 506. Yoo later tells Noh and Yoon that after he locked up Ma and his men, it was not the end of the problem. Private Cho was found breaking his hand with a wrench after being ordered to fix the shower room pipes. Yoo talked to Kim again about the incident, but he still remembered nothing. As they talk, Kim supposedly saw the dark silhouette of what he thinks is Sergeant Ma walking towards the medic room where they were. He went hysterical and pointed the shadow out to Yoo. Yoo turned around to face the shadow, only to black out for a few minutes. When he was woken by the medic, Sergeant Kwon, he found that Kim was dead on his bed. After the incident, he ordered the confiscation of live ammo from his men. In the present, some MPs go sick from the rain pouring outside. Doc is unable to find any cold medicine, which supposedly should have sufficient amounts of it. Meanwhile, Cpl. Kwak and his buddy are sent for sentry duty. He finds a dark room. Suddenly the door closes behind him, and loud banging sounds come towards him. Sergeant Yoon washes his hands in the toilet and finds strange rashes on them. He hears a sound in one of the cubicles and investigates. He discovers Cpl. Kwak, who is supposed to be on sentry, bashing his platoon mate to death with his rifle butt. He goes off to inform Noh, who along with other men rush to the toilet, only to find the dead soldier and no sign of Kwak. They find Kwak in the room he first went in. When they shine their torches on him, Kwak’s clothes are found with blood, with him feeling confused. He is arrested and interrogated, but he claims that he does not remember anything. Doc arrives to check on Kwak’s neck, finding the rashes. Flashback: Sergeant Ju and his men broke into the radio room, armed and threatening to kill anyone who enter. The group said that 1st Lt. Yoo lied to HQ about the situation in 506. Yoo, Cpl. Kang and another sergeant went in to defuse the situation, but is unable to convince the group to drop their weapons. They struggle with the men and one of them fires his rifle, killing the sergeant. Yoo ordered Sergeant Ju and his group to be arrested, but by now most of his men, including Kang, having enough of it, refused his orders. They instead locked him up inside the generator room. Later, the men intended to call HQ, but the radio was broken during the gunfight. Sergeant Kwon found that the doors leading out of the bunker are locked, and asks Yoo in the generator room at gunpoint, where the keys are. Yoo refuses and both of them struggle, leading to Yoo killing Kwon by shooting him in the head. In the present, Yoo tells Noh about all this, and Noh asks him if there is a disease going around. However, Yoo shook his head. Doc inspects the bodies and finds rashes on their chests. He summons Cpl. Kwak and tears open his shirt, only to find the same rashes within. Later, Noh and Doc discuss the same symptoms present in the other bodies and some of their men. In a matter of hours, the disease that inflicted the men of 506 will be present in their men as well. Doc surmises that a rabic-like virus infects the men, making them turn violent and kill each other, but he does not know how the infection spreads. Whatever is out there in the woods was left untouched for 50 years, due to North-South Korea confrontations over it. Noh wants to know why Cpl. Kang killed the rest of his mates, but Doc says that is not important, as the disease may be spreading as they speak. Later Noh examines the video recording again, and searches through the 506 men’s belongings. He discovers a photobook and as he looks through it, he finds something important and rushes to look for Yoo, but he is missing. At the same time, Yoo has sneaked out of 506, and unbeknownst to the driver and sentry, enters the ambulance to look at the dead Cpl. Kang. Flashback: The truth is revealed, 1st Lt. Yoo was actually part of Sergeant Ma and his men’s group when they went into the woods. He was also sick along with the rest when they came back to base. When Kim saw the dark shadow, it was fact an illusion and Yoo was the one who suddenly spasmed while questioning Kim and beat him to death with the IV drip pole. The medic, Sergeant Kwon, found him drenched in blood. Later, Kwon advised him to contact HQ and tell them about the situation, but Yoo, who did not want to go down for killing someone, refused to accept and thought that he could fix this situation. He intended to rewrite the duty logs of what happened, and told Kwon to dispose his bloody clothes without anyone knowing. After making his report to HQ, Yoo turned to Kwon, whose face is the man Noh and the others found in the generator room. Only after seeing the photobook, Noh realizes the man they thought was 1st Lt. Yoo was not, he was in fact Sergeant Kwon. In the present, the man who is Sergeant Kwon sneaks out of the ambulance and is discovered by the sentry. He gets into a struggle with him and breaks the sentry’s neck. As Kwon picks up the sentry’s rifle, the sentry’s face starts to bloat in front of his eyes and he makes croaking noises. Kwon, unable to shoot him with the rifle, takes out his knife and stabs him in the hand. When the ambulance driver tells Noh of Kwon’s presence and murder, he along with his men rush outside, only to see Kwon trying to escape using the ambulance. He runs over the sentry’s body. Noh runs after him and fires his gun, managing to make Kwon lose control and crash into the side of the bunker. Noh drags him out of the vehicle. As this is going on, the dead sentry suddenly comes back to life and stabs one of the soldiers standing near his body. Noh takes one of his men’s rifles, shoots the seemingly undead corpse and finally makes him stop moving. Kwon is then locked and tied back up in the generator room. Flashback: After locking Yoo up, Kwon is unable to tell the 506 men about their symptoms they are having, despite being the medic and having to keep the truth about Yoo to the men. Later when he hid in the room where the infected men were kept while Kang chased him and demanded an answer, he suffocated one of the infected, Hoon, to death to end his suffering. In the present, Noh, Doc, 1st Lt. Bang and the sergeants gather the remaining men for an inspection due to the disease. Doc divides up the men according to whether they have the rashes on their bodies. However, when Noh orders the infected to strip their weapons and hand them over, they refuse and the soldiers present have a standoff. Meanwhile, Kwon, tied up in the generator room, struggles with his bonds and knocks out the electric supply temporarily, blacking out the bunker. This causes the infected men to fire out of fear, killing Bang and most of the non-infected soldiers. Later, Doc checks up Kwak, only to find the rashes gone. Noh goes to Kwon’s cell and demands to know everything. Flashback: Yoo learnt that Kwon wanted to revolt his command by telling HQ all of what has happened. He threatened to blame Kwon that all the deaths that happened was due to Kwon’s mutiny, but the latter is unfazed. He instead blamed Yoo for going into the woods and bringing back the disease, turning them into monsters. He intends to survive, no matter the cost. Later, a soldier discovers a corpse in Yoo’s cell and thinks it was Yoo who killed Kwon and escaped, due to the corpse’s face battered beyond recognition and his clothes belonged to Kwon’s. After the soldier left, Kwon hides in a dark corner without his uniform, muttering that he will survive. He hid until the MPs from Noh’s command finds him down there. He assumes Yoo’s identity to Noh and his men. Noh, upon learning the truth from Kwon, beats him up in anger, due to him withholding the truth and his own selfish reasons of wanting to live, have caused his own men and Noh's group to die. Kwon retorts back, saying that HQ did not care about them when they were dying like mad dogs here. Later, while staring at the rain outside, Noh touches his family photo and comes to a terrible resolution. He goes into the office and finds the keys to the bunker. When leaving, he hears sobbing sounds from a corner, to find Sergeant Yoon. He discovers Yoon is infected. He embraces the crying Yoon and unknown to him, points a gun to his head. Yoon, realizing what he is about to do, struggles from his grasp. Noh shoots him dead and slumps himself in a corner. After he recovers, Noh goes into the armory and collects weapons, while Doc asks him if he wants to report to HQ about this. Noh, not answering him, instead asks if there’s a cure to the disease. Doc does not know, the only thing he understands is that the virus would not survive in open air without a host, and it will die if the host dies too. Noh says that if they all die, the virus will die with them too. Doc understands what he is going to do and tries to stop him, but Noh is adamant in his decision. He now understands why Cpl. Kang had to kill all his mates. He checks Doc’s hand, to find it covered in rashes. He then leaves Doc without a word. Meanwhile, the infected men have decided to deny the virus ever existed, and wants to leave with the soldiers that will arrive to clean up at 7.00am. They hide their rashes under camo paint. Sergeant Lee, one of the infected, organizes the men and prepares to leave, no matter the consequences. Kwon wakes up in his cell and finds a supposedly dead Kang approaching him with his axe. However, it turns out to be Noh, who shoots him dead. The infected soldiers find the door leading outside the bunker put under heavy locks. Another soldier reports that both Yoon and Kwak were found dead with a gunshot wound . Lee with the soldiers intend to fabricate a report for HQ, that Kang killed his men and later Yoo went insane and killed their own men too, and that there’s no mysterious disease. Lee orders the men to look for Noh, who is busy spilling kerosene all around the rooms, passageways and corridors of the bunker. Lee and the soldiers manage to corner Noh in the shower room. Unable to kill Noh, Lee wants him to join them and deny that the disease ever happened, but Noh refuses. Doc enters the room with a rifle, having decided to aid Noh. Lee demands the keys to the bunker but Noh refuses to give them. One of the soldiers goes hysterical and fires at Noh and the gunfight ensues among the men. Noh and Doc manages to kill 3 of the men, with Noh injured. Doc runs out of ammo in the end and is shot to death by Lee. Noh retaliates by killing Lee. However, the only soldier left, a private fires at him. Noh collapses on the ground, coughing out blood, and then dies. The private grabs the keys from his dead body and staggers all the way to the entrance. Outside, new soldiers sent from HQ arrive to meet up with Noh and his men. The private fumbles with the keys and opens the door to the bunker, thinking that he can finally get out, only to watch in horror as a tripwire breaks when the door is opened, which is connected to explosives. The blast kills the private instantly, and the explosion sparks the kerosene inside the bunker, washing it aflame. The soldiers approaching the bunker instantly drop to the ground for safety, while GP 506 has turned into a smoking ruin. The final scene shows Cpl. Kang in the video-cam recording as it was before it became spoilt. “I’m Specialist Kang of GP 506. We are all infected with a mysterious disease. This is the sign.” He shows the cam the rashes on his chest. “It makes you violent and attack other people. After a while, it becomes dormant, but it’s more dangerous. I’m putting an end to this. By the time this tape is found, we should all be dead. If you find any survivors…kill them.” He is later shown holding a birthday cake and carrying a bag of weapons, silently walking along the corridor to the rec room. His other platoon mates are heard wondering why he asked them all to gather. As he enters the room, his mates tell him that they don’t have time for this. Gunfire suddenly ensues in the room and screams are heard, and the film ends.""]"

Twenty-two years later, he is awakened in the midst of a raging battle between armored soldiers and insectoid beings called the ""Blue"" which have overrun the Earth. The group of soldiers are from an orbiting space colony collectively called Second Earth and were ordered to recover ""sleepers"" around the Earth. Among them is the soldier Marlene Angel, who at first appears to be heartless toward others. On the journey to the space colony, Second Earth,Yuji meets many of the humans that were left behind during the evacuation due to limited resources. Standing orders for Marlene and the other troops are to consider any human survivors on the surface to be already dead, which greatly troubles Yuji. On their journey all of the soldiers are killed, except for Marlene, causing Yuji to fall into a deep depression as he recognizes the destruction around him and his own inability to save those he cares about. During their travel to Baikonur space base through the mountains, Yuji and Marlene start to develop a bond that starts to soften her sharp edges. Eventually, in Russia, Yuji and Marlene come across another group of soldiers and devise a battle plan to get back to Second Earth. During the operation to escape to Second Earth, Marlene is the last remaining pilot and completely overrun by the Blue. Just when Marlene is about to self-detonate her Armor Shrike, Yuji arrives. Determined not to leave her behind he comes to her rescue with a team of supporters . Marlene is overwhelmed at Yuji\'s efforts to save her. This is a turning point for Marlene and her feelings for Yuji are quite clear for the rest of the series. During the shuttle flight to Second Earth, Marlene and Yuji expose their emotions for each other. Marlene and Yuji\'s scene is abruptly interrupted as a mutated Blue which hid in the shuttle attacks Yuji, critically injuring him. Upon arrival, Marlene and Yuji are separated, and Marlene is sent back into training at the education station. Not knowing what happened after he was attacked, Marlene rebels and is bent on finding Yuji. When she does, she finds he is healed and being trained to use a new specialized ""sleeper""-specific Armor Shrike  called the ""Double Edge"", a battlesuit that is much stronger than the originals used in war against the Blue. It is discovered the illness that Yuji is afflicted with is the key to help destroying the Blue and taking back the planet. He, and other ""Sleepers"", have ""B-cells"" which are also the genetic make up of the Blue. After intensive training, Yuji and Marlene return to Earth with two other ""Sleepers"" named Tony Frost and Alicia Whistle. Tony is an inexperienced A.S pilot, but his B-cells are very adept, giving him great A.S skills. Alicia is only a young teenager with no combat experience and not much sense as to what is going on around her. They and the other forces of Second Earth battle the Blue. They become successful at destroying a few of the largest nests before they head back to Second Earth. However, the battles begin to have a negative effect on Yuji who gives very little regard for human life and is completely obsessed with being better than Tony at killing Blue. Yuji\'s actions deeply concern Marlene and she begins to know something is wrong. Shortly after returning to Second Earth, the High Council orders the ""Sleepers"" on a second offensive against the Blue. Marlene is separated from Yuji once again, but in his current state he does not seem to care. As the ""Sleepers"" are carrying out their mission, a battle on Second Earth between two factions is waged. Seno, the head of Second Earth\'s science division, leads the ""Ark"" rebellion taking control of the military, lunar resource, and education stations of Second Earth. The High Council escapes to and retains control of the medical station. During this time Marlene learns about the nature of the illness that put Yuji in stasis, the source of his abilities, and the source of the Blue Insectoids. They are a defense mechanism enacted by the Earth to purge the existence of humanity, and the B-cells that exist in the ""Sleepers"" could become a potential threat to humanity as well. After the ""Ark"" successfully takes over Second earth from the ignorant High Council, Marlene heads down to earth in search of Yuji. When she finds him his B-cells are already beginning to activate and he begins to go berserk as a killing machine. After struggling and fighting with him, Marlene is finally able to get through to Yuji and helps him overcome his madness by showing her human emotions and feelings for him . Meanwhile, Tony and an unknowing Alicia have also abandoned the remaining grounds forces. The troops fend off waves of Blue before escaping with the few remaining survivors. Tony and a now brainwashed Alicia also eventually return to Second Earth, but bring with them several Blue when they board the medical station. When Yuji and Marlene return to Second Earth, they find that Tony plans to ram the medical station into the military station, which would therefore destroy the heart of Second Earth. He sees this as the ""Grand Will of the Earth"", in which he will become a ""messiah"" and cleanse the planet of humanity forever. However, Yuji, Marlene, and a group of other soldiers infiltrate the station, and manage to free Alicia\'s mind after injuring her. Later, Yuji and Marlene confront and eliminate Tony, while Rick  is slaughtered by a Blue. Alicia ventures back to Tony to die with him as the military destroys the medical station. After the decision by Seno\'s junta to abandon Earth, Yuji becomes depressed and contemplates his existence, wondering what he has been fighting for, why he was woken, why he cannot save his friends , and what is truly Earth\'s will. However, Marlene again is able to get through to Yuji and the two realize they need each other and finally become lovers. Yuji decides to return to Earth to once and for all find out what Earth\'s Will is. After learning from Seno about a new migration pattern of the Blue, Yuji and Marlene take a group of volunteers and head to an area where a massive nest is located. There they find a group of humans who seem to be surviving in the area. The nest seems impenetrable at first, but they eventually find an entrance with the help of the local people. The entrance leads to a tunnel where the walls, ceiling, and floor of the cavern are composed of fossil-like Blue. The team finally comes upon a crystal formation in a massive cavern. A huge Blue is birthed from the gel substance sitting atop the formation and kills everyone except for Yuji and Marlene. Yuji kills it and comes to the conclusion that the sphere will hold the answers he seeks. He sends Marlene, who is pregnant with their child, away to the surface to wait for him. He then gets a vision and can see what the earth itself can see. Yuji comes to understand how mankind can live alongside the B-Cells and returns to Marlene. Meanwhile, Second Earth\'s military station\'s citizens revolt against Seno. The station\'s personnel proceed to abandon the station for Earth via shuttles. Eventually a firefight erupts over the last remaining overcrowded shuttle, and the station is destroyed by a massive explosion. All around the world from former Blue Nests, long strings of coalescing energy ascend into Earth\'s atmosphere and form a ring. Marlene and Yuji watch this, realizing Earth is now a safe place to be and look forward to the rest of their lives together as the sun sets. A final view of the Earth from space is shown with a slightly garbled narration, presumably by the Earth, stating, ""Welcome to your next journey"".', ""3 years on since first meeting the Railway Dragon, Emily manages to summon him to her house one night by shouting tidings. Upon his arrival, Emily reveals to him that she would like him to come to her birthday party and meet her other friends. The dragon, however, is reluctant as he feels that the world is not yet safe for him, despite Emily telling him there are lots of people like her who can make the world safe for dragons. Furthermore, the dragon is curious as to what a birthday is. Emily shows him through a projector after going through different slides, including a picture of the forest and the zoo, before finding a pic from one of her earlier birthday parties and explaining to the dragon that a birthday is a celebration of the day you were born . Furthermore, Emily tells him about the best part of birthdays, which is receiving presents, before showing him by making him a present , and giving it to him to unwrap, much to his delight. When Emily tells him if he comes it will be the best present she could ask for, as well as assuring him that he'll be safe, the Dragon happily agrees to come to her party before flying off into the night. The next morning, the boss of a circus informs two bumbling clowns, Lenny and Clarence, that they have another birthday party to do. Clarence is an overweight man who enjoys clowning, but is quite dumb and easily sidetracked. Lenny, on the other hand, hates it and is constantly infuriated by Clarence while looking for a way to get a better job. At Emily's party, Emily has made everyone dress up as dragons to help the Railway Dragon blend in, which is successful. Lenny and Clarence perform to the children but both mess up, so Emily, the dragon and the children move onto the games. It all goes well, until a blindfolded child playing 'Pin the tail on the donkey' accidentally stabs the dragon in the butt, causing him to fly up and roar, scaring the children away in the process. Angry, the Dragon tells Emily is was a mistake coming to her party and flies off back to his Railway tunnel, despite Emily calling for him to come back. This is watched by both Lenny and Clarence, with both realising the dragon is real and Lenny now believing they have a way to 'get to the top'. The two clowns follow Emily to try and find the Dragon's lair, unbeknown to her. However, they lose track of her when she slides down the burrow into the Railway Dragon's lair. Although she cannot find the dragon, she tells him that just because things went bad at the party doesn't mean they can't still be friends, and states that she 'doesn't want a world without dragons' before leaving the cave. In the forest, the other dragons she met on the Day of Tidings appear to her to try and cheer her up, but she sends them away and tells them that they must hide where humans aren't looking. In his cave, the Railway dragon tearfully looks back on the days events before finding the Noah's Ark clock he received from Emily. Upset at how he has hurt Emily's feelings , he comes up with a plan to make it up to her by giving her the best present ever. That night, Emily is woken up and finds various zoo animals in her house and garden before seeing the Dragon outside and hugging him. The dragon reveals he has brought almost all the animals from the zoo  as her birthday present. Emily tells him it is a wonderful present, but it's not safe in the world right now for the animals. The dragon and Emily both agree that they must work till they make it safe again for both the zoo animals and for dragons. They are interrupted, however, by Lenny and Clarence . As the Dragon roars and advances towards them, the two clowns spring their trap and catch the Railway Dragon in a net attached to a circus pickup truck. As they drive off, Emily shouts tidings to call the other dragons. Together, they quickly capture both Lenny and Clarence  before freeing the Railway Dragon. While the other dragons 'play' with the two clowns, Emily and the Railway Dragon manage to return all the animals back to the Zoo before the Zoo owner realises they're missing. At the Circus, the Boss takes several days wages from Lenny and Clarence for various reasons including their 'stupid story' about the Dragons. As Lenny is about to complain to Clarence, the two look up fearfully as Emily and the Dragon fly overhead, with both clowns agreeing that they didn't see anything. In the sky, the railway dragon takes Emily for another fun ride before flying back to the railway tunnel with her. He is upset as he has not been able to give her a present to keep, but Emily reassures him that she has a wonderful present to keep; a memory of the day's events and also that she and the dragon are still friends. As the dragon happily states that the day feels like his birthday also, Emily surprises him as the other dragons appear  and wish him happy birthday, before both himself and Emily blow out the candles on the cake together."", '{{plot}} The disgraced former executioner, or Kogi Kaishakunin to the shogun, Ogami Ittō is now living rough on the land with his three-year-old son Daigoro, travelling the countryside as a hired killer. Pushing his son in a baby cart, he stops at a bathhouse looking for a room and a bath, and is eagerly welcomed in by a young woman. However, the manager of the house sees Ittō as a dirty vagabond and scolds the young woman for letting him in the house. Overhearing this, Ittō goes to the baby cart and retrieves a bundle and hands it to the manager for safe keeping – it is 500 gold pieces, earned from a recent job. The manager\'s tone quickly changes, but when he tries to wash Daigoro\'s feet, the boy kicks water at the old man and tromps across the floor, leaving wet footprints. Ittō\'s activities are being watched by the Kurokawa spy clan of shinobi-class ninja, which have fallen in with Ittō\'s nemesis, the Shadow Yagyū. They report on his activities to Sayaka, head of Akari Yagyū clan of female assassins. But the Kurokawa are unsure that the women are up to the task of killing Ittō. Sayaka laughs confidently and tells the Kurokawas\' leader to send their best man into the room. She then orders the man to try to exit the room. He tries to do so by grappling onto the ceiling, but the female assassins set upon him and make short work of him, hacking off his ears, fingers, arms and legs, leaving the man a writhing heap of just a torso and head before he is finally finished off. Ittō, meanwhile, is hired by a clan that specializes in making indigo dye and has a secret process. One of the clan plans to sell out the secret to the shogun. Ittō must kill him. The turncoat will be escorted by the Hidari brothers, each a master of a deadly weapon – the iron claw, the flying mace and a pair of armored gloves. As he travels to his job, Ittō encounters three groups of female assassins. The first group is disguised as an acrobat troupe that turns deadly as their gymnastic moves are combined with blades and turned against Ittō. He then encounters a pair of women who with blades on their straw hats that they throw at Ittō as if they are Frisbees. Finally, some women washing vegetables by the river turn out to be assassins and the daikons they are washing are wielded as weapons. Ittō kills them all. Then he meets Sayaka, who catches him, his son and the baby cart in a steel net. Ittō cuts his way out of the net and engages in a sword duel with her. He delivers what should be a disabling blow to her ankles, but the woman fighter jumps straight up out of her kimono to reveal a fishnet body suit and then runs away, bizarrely jogging backwards. Next, the Kurokawa clan are waiting for Ittō, who puts together his naginata  and gives the baby cart a shove toward the waiting enemies. Daigoro, still in the baby cart then activates blades in the axles of the cart, which cut off the feet of several men. The battle that ensues between Ittō and the Kurokawas is fierce and Ittō is injured before he has killed them all. Weary from the endless fighting, Ittō struggles along the road and eventually finds shelter in a shack. Daigoro, seeing that his father needs his help, must do what he can. Unable to carry water in his tiny hands, Daigoro carries water from the river in the only vessel available – his mouth. He spits the few drops he could carry between his father\'s parched lips. For food, Daigoro finds some rice cakes given as an offering to a Buddha statue and takes them for his father, leaving his vest in exchange. Ittō recovers and finds that his son is missing. Daigoro has been taken by the Kurokawa and Sayaka, tied up and suspended over a water well. If Ittō attacks, they will let go of the rope and Daigoro will plunge to his death. Daigoro lets his sandal drop into the well, giving Ittō a gauge of how deep it is. He then makes his move as the rope unspools, stopping it just in time. Sayaka watches silently and makes no move to engage the swordsman, realising his technique far outstrips her own and perhaps also out of a sense of honor for the devotion of the father to his child. Ittō then finds himself aboard a ship, carrying the three Hidari brothers. Ittō is met by several other members of the indigo-dye clan, who try to kill the Hidaris but are bloodily rebuffed. The clan then sets the ship on fire in an attempt to kill the Hidaris, but the three killers escape. Ittō tosses Daigoro and the baby cart into the water, the cart proves itself by floating. Sayaka has followed Ittō onto the ship and in the water, she tries to kill him, but is disarmed. Ittō, with Daigoro and Sayaka, find shelter, but they are cold. Ittō disrobes himself and Daigoro, then turns on Sayaka, tearing off her clothes. But he does not mean to rape her. Instead, he is seeking to get her out of her cold, wet clothes and cling to her while nude. ""Three people are warmer than two,"" he explains. She thinks about taking his sword and killing him, but the cozy scene, with Daigoro sitting between them, playfully fondling her breast, makes her abandon the plan. The final showdown takes place on a vast area of sand dunes. The Hidari brothers are at the head of a caravan of men carrying a palanquin with the indigo expert inside. The brother with the iron claw runs forward and thrusts his claw into the sand, which boils up with blood. There are men hiding in the sand. He digs his claw into the sand several times, each time creating a pool of blood and pulling up a hiding warrior by his head. The rest of the hidden men in the sand emerge and fight, but the Hidari brothers dispatch them all. Ittō awaits, alone, at the top of a large dune. Each brother is dispatched in a high-pressure spray of blood, with the last brother dispatched in a lethal stroke along the throat, a cut that sprays blood in a fine mist, while making a sound like the ""howling of the wind"". The final slain Hidari brother comments such a fabled finishing stroke is referred to as ""Mogaribue"", and wishes he had heard the sound just once from the many people he has killed, but is instead hearing it from his own neck as his life slowly drains away. Ittō approaches the palanquin with the traitorous indigo expert inside, finishing him before gathering Daigoro and again setting off. The end sees them out of the desert and on a coastal trail, followed by Sayaka. Aware of her presence Ittō stops the cart, looking straight ahead whilst holding out his dotanuki blade, as Sayaka wielding a katana is revealed behind him. Ittō stands ominously still until he hears the sound of Sayaka dropping her sword; knowing that she can never defeat the master swordsman.']"

Wealthy ranch owner, Bernardo Elizondo, has been having an affair with the Reyes brothers\' younger sister, Libia . Libia falls in love with him and becomes pregnant but when the old hacienda owner dies, she commits suicide. The Reyes brothers put the blame of their sister\'s death with the Elizondo household and plot revenge against them by pretending to be construction workers/house makers on their hacienda. The Reyes brothers unexpectedly fall for Bernardo\'s three daughters, Norma, Jimena, and Sarita . Juan Reyes is the eldest sibling. He is a tall, strong man with shoulder length brown hair. He is extremely protective of his siblings, especially Libia. He is usually quiet and calm, but when provoked he can be very impulsive and violent. He is deeply hurt by his sister\'s death since he loved her very much. He is ready to avenge Libia\'s death, by tricking Bernando\'s daughters as he had done with Libia. When he meets Norma Elizondo, he is amazed by her beauty and feels a connection to her. She has long light brown hair and an exquisite face. She was forced to marry Fernando Escandón , a rather insensitive and cruel man, to escape family shame. She was raped by three intruders years ago and is so shaken by it, she cannot let any man touch her, including her husband. But when she meets Juan, all those fears go away and she falls in love with him. After many obstacles, they later marry and have a baby boy, Juan David, who has Norma\'s pale skin and Juan\'s large eyes. Oscar Reyes is the second oldest. He is handsome, well-built, and has a beautiful smile. He can be arrogant, rude and very greedy at times. Still, he has a good heart and can be kind, sweet, and incredibly clever. Sometimes he schemes to get money, like for example he makes his younger brother go on dates with older, rich woman to make money. Jimena Elizondo is a beautiful model who wants to live life to the fullest and immediately takes a liking to the Reyes brothers. She truly does fall in love with Oscar, even though she denies it sometimes and is joyed when he asks her to marry him.

He is in love with Rosario Montes , a bar dancer who mostly just humiliates him. When she marries the greedy bar owner, he is crushed. Out of spite, he marries an old, rich woman who had been obsessed with him. She dies on their wedding day leaving all her money to Franco. Sara ""Sarita"" Elizondo is serious, uptight, and dedicated to managing her family\'s hacienda. Although she is extremely beautiful, she would rather be with the horses than with men. She falls in love with Franco after many incidents between them, though she pretends very often that she hates him. She later comes out of her shell and learns that she can not control who she falls in love with. Libia Reyes is a beautiful 17-year-old girl and the youngest of the Reyes siblings. She is quiet, sweet, rather innocent, and loves her brothers very much, despite their overprotective manners. She lives in a poor barrio and lives a humble life. She doesn\'t go out much, and it\'s suggested that she never had a boyfriend before, because of her brothers\' protectiveness. When she meets Bernando Elizando, she falls in love with him despite their major age difference. Bernando lies to her, telling her that he is single and lives with his sister and three nieces. But he also falls in love with her. The Reyes brothers find out about them and they are all furious that she didn\'t tell them. Especially that Bernando is much older than all of them. But when it is discoovered that Libia is pregnant, they allow the marriage between their sister and Bernando. Bernando dies in an accident, leaving Libia devastated and angry because of his lies. Encouraged by a nosy store owner and her sons, she goes to the Elizando mansion to talk to Bernando\'s widow, Gabriela Elizando , who humiliates her by calling her a slut and a gold digger in front of everybody. Crying hysterically, she leaves the mansion. Libia then proceeds to kill herself by jumping off a bridge and falling in a lake. When her brothers find out, they are devastated and swear on their sister\'s tomb that they\'ll avenge her death. Later on the Reyes brothers meet Ruth Uribe , a rich girl who looks exactly like Libia. The Reyes brothers are amazed by their resemblance and consider her their adoptive little sister. Ruth represents the symbol the Reyes brothers can still hold to Libia. It is later revealed that Ruth is the Reyes\' cousin, explaining Libia and Ruth\'s resemblance. The plot reaches a climax when Gabriela marries a very dangerous suitor, none other than her former son-in-law, Fernando. He manages to alienate Gabriela\'s family, virtually take control of the estate, and spend much of her money on gambling and raucous living. Gabriela refuses to see the truth until it is too late and she soon finds herself in grave danger. The Reyes brothers must then take action.', 'Most of the film is silent and there are just as few dialogue lines as necessary. In the initial sequence during the opening credits, in a black screen the audience can hear different sounds of prison gates opening and someone walking down corridors, then shouts are heard and the audience is brought just outside the prison where Bruno Le Roux, a former leftist revolutionary, has just escaped. An accomplice in a mask, Jean-Jean, is waiting for him, he shoots the searchlights and both climb into a car and escape through the streets into the country. They come across a police blockade but manage to escape through a hail of bullets. The next morning Bruno lies on the grass, Jean-Jean is dead. Bruno takes everything in the car and disguises himself.  He heads to Grenoble, France, in the train but runs into the police at the train station; he manages to escape and runs into a safe-house in a garage within an apartment complex. News of his escapade reach other people involved with him in his past, amongst them Jacquillat, a drug dealer and owner of a fronting company related to transportation of goods and Jeanne and Francis, former revolutionaries. Francis wanders if Bruno shall be coming to their place but she is sure that he will try to escape to Italy. Bruno forges identifications and arranges many looks for himself, steals a car, changes the licence plates and connects a radio scanner so he can hear the feedback of the police on him. The Police are tailing Jeanne. That night Bruno pays a visit to Freddy, who obviously shares some past with him, Le Roux demands to see Jacquillat and Freddy reluctantly agrees to call him after offering help to take Bruno to Italy, which he will not do until some old scores have been settled with Jacquillat. Freddy goes to the back of the shop, Bruno sees from the window a group of policemen and also has a glimpse at Police Inspector Pascal Manise, whom he had seen earlier in the train station, and assumes that Freddy has betrayed him, he leaves the bar and sees Manise enter. He calls Freddy to tell him that it was not a smart move. Jacquillat has made his office his refuge and sends his henchmen after Le Roux. Freddy fears for his life and has become paranoid as he runs the streets he sees Bruno everywhere but when he arrives at his apartment he seems more relaxed only to be shot at the entrance of his building by Le Roux. Bruno shows up at Jeanne\'s, it turns out that she was actually expecting him and gives him a bunch of keys that she has been keeping and burns communist pamphlets that she had hidden away in her son\'s closet for 15 years. While the Police investigate Freddy\'s murder, Bruno gets a glimpse at Jacquillat but does not engage him, because he is talking to Manise. Bruno pays a visit to Madame Guiot, the mother of Jean-Jean and tells her that he is dead and that now he will take care of her, she refuses and throws him out. Le Roux goes to an apartment with the new keys but he tries to open the wrong door and a neighbour emerges from the apartment, he apologizes for the mistake and goes to his apartment, but now there is a witness about his looks and knows that he must change his plans. He takes a lot of explosive materials from the apartment and guns and burns the apartment. He bombs the Court House. This triggers the police to arrest Jeanne for questioning but she is still loyal to him and will not say a word. In the meantime, Le Roux has been following Jacquillat\'s henchmen and ends up following Banane, a petty drug dealer, who while selling drugs on the street ends up beating a woman, at first Le Roux does not intervene but the beating is so strong that he cannot take it anymore and engages Banane with his gun and forces him to open the letterbox where he hides his drugs, she takes all she can and leaves. Bruno frisks Banane and finds a photo of the woman who has just left; Banane has been ordered not to sell her anything. Bruno poses then as ""Yvan"" says that he wants to meet Jacquillat. Just as he is about to leave, the woman comes back with news that the police is all around the place. They must wait it out but she is very sick from withdrawal syndrome, she offers to take him to her place where he will be safe after she figures out that the police is looking for him, her husband is Manise and no one shall look for him there. Once at the apartment she shoots up and falls asleep. Just as he is about to leave, Agnès  keels over and is about to die due to overdose, Bruno hesitates but finally saves her. While he is washing her wounds in the bathroom she tells him that in 15 years of marriage, her husband has always provided her with all the drugs she wanted but now he has stopped and it is the first time that she has had to buy her own fixes. He promises her to help her get more drugs. He tells her that his name is Pierre. Jeanne is liberated. Early in the morning Bruno goes to Banane\'s and learns that a meeting with Jacquillat has been set at 23:00. Later that same morning, while Jeanne is preparing a little celebration for her liberation, Bruno asks her to help him that night, she refuses to help him and the only thing that she will do for him is cross him over the border into Italy. He refuses and reminds her that she has been free and able to live her life only because he and all the others who have spent time in prison have kept their mouths shut, therefore she owes them, he will come at 22:45 for her. Agnès takes ""Pierre"" to a chalet in the mountains and promises him to get a car. In the chalet, while preparing for that evening, Bruno is confronted by Cécile the owner of the chalet, because Cécile thinks that her husband is having an affair with Agnès. They tell her that he is Pierre an unemployed machinist and Agnès\' lover, after Cécile is more calm she offers to get him a job and leaves. Bruno goes to Jeanne\'s but she is not there. He goes alone to the meeting which turns out to be an ambush, there is shoot out, many are killed. Bruno manages to escape and calls for Jeanne to help him. She takes him to the chalet, where they discuss about Bruno\'s outdated ideas and demands to know that if he can justify the deaths of several innocent people that they have killed during their terrorist attacks. Jeanne confesses to Francis what she did , but when asked about Le Roux\'s whereabouts, she still will not say anything.  The next day at the chalet Bruno is confronted again by Cécile, who now believes that he is Agnès\' dealer and the one who is blackmailing Manise but he denies it and tells her that Manise actually is a wife beater, she leaves. Bruno knows he has to leave and steals a car that happened to be near the chalet. Once in the city he is cut off by many police blockades, he dumps the car and goes to Jeanne\'s, but she is not there. When she arrives, Bruno beats Francis to force her to help him. She unwittingly reveals that the police will not search her car because they are not looking for a woman with a child. Bruno has Jeanne tie Francis up and they leave her apartment with the child. They pass the blockade and he then manages to arrive at his safe house in the garage, but does not know that Jeanne has followed him. She then goes to Manise\'s place and tells him where to find Le Roux. Manise discloses Le Roux\'s location to both the police and Jacquillat. Le Roux hears movements outside his hide out and manages to escape, the police and Jacquillat\'s henchmen have engaged in a shoot out which gives him the opportunity to leave undetected. He goes to Jacquillat\'s office where he shoots him and takes his car with which he goes to the chalet. He starts climbing the Alps in order to escape to Italy but on the top of a mountain he walks into a crevasse, he tries to climb out but he cannot and sinks to the bottom.', 'Ferdinando Cefalù , an impoverished Sicilian nobleman, is married to Rosalia , an unattractive but devoted wife. However, he is in love with his cousin Angela , a very much younger and attractive woman whom he sees only during the summers because her family sends her away to the city to a nunnery to receive her education. Besides his wife, he shares his life with his elderly parents and his spinster sister and her boyfriend who runs a funeral business; the family share their once stately palace with his uncles, who are slowly but surely eating away the remainders of the then rich estate of the Baron. Ferdinando spends his spare time  imagining several ways in which he can do away with his wife, such as throwing her into a boiling caldron to turn her into soap or sending her into space in a rocket. After a chance encounter with Angela during a family trip, he discovers that she shares his feelings. With this, he resolves to carry out his plans and is inspired by a local story of a woman who killed her husband in a rage of jealousy to make his wife have an affair so that he can catch her in flagrante delicto, murder her, and receive a light sentence for committing an honor killing, studying very carefully the Criminal Code. As he goes along fleshing out his plan, he first needs to find a suitable man for his wife, which he finds in the local priest\'s godson, Carmelo Patanè, who has had feelings for Rosalia for years and was presumed dead in Africa during World War II. He then also procures the State Prosecutor\'s undying friendship by feeding his love for alcohol. The final stage of his plan is arranging to have Carmelo\'s constant presence in his house, which is achieved by his interest in having his palace restored. The plan takes a while to get off the ground, because Carmelo is very shy and Rosalia is more than a match in conjugal fidelity. Ferdinando is aware of the development of his plan because he has been taping all their conversations and has to ward off the help\'s infatuation with Carmelo. During his monitoring of the entire plan, Ferdinando discovers that Carmelo is actually married with three children and a philanderer who could be easily distracted by any other passing skirt. However, his plan turns out better than expected when Rosalia and Carmelo finally give in to their passion; but as he eavesdrops the tape runs out at the precise moment the adulterers arrange for their next illicit meeting. All Ferdinando knows is that it will take place the next evening. Rosalia feigns to have a terrible headache and remains home while the rest of the family go out to the theatre to see the première of a film so scandalous that no one wishes to miss it. Ferdinando sneaks out of the theatre and goes back to the palace, arriving just in time to see Rosalia running to the train station. He initially has to run out after her but still has to retrieve the gun to kill the couple; and as a result he misses the train and the lovers in it. He revisits his plan and the Criminal Code, which calls for a crime of passion to be executed in the heat of the moment or in defense of one\'s honor; this then means changing his plan and passing off as the cuckold. All the while Angela has been writing to Ferdinando to assure her of her undying love no matter what; however, one of her letters is misdelivered to her father who dies of a stroke upon reading it. At the funeral, Ferdinando is approached by Mrs. Patanè who demands to know what he will do to avenge their situation. Since Ferdinando is still doing nothing, she spits in his face in front of the entire town, which gives him all that he needed: an open insult to the family\'s honor due to his wife\'s elopement. The local mafia boss offers to find the lovers within 24 hours, which he does. As Ferdinando goes to the lovers\' hideout, he comes across Mrs. Patanè, who has just shot her husband, which actually leaves him in a worse position than before. As he sees no other choice, he follows in Mrs. Patanè\'s footsteps and finally kills his wife. During his trial he is actually defended by the State Prosecutor who blames the whole thing on Ferdinando\'s father and his lack of love when raising him as a boy. He spends no more than three years in jail and finally comes back home to find a loving Angela waiting for him. In the film\'s epilogue, Ferdinando and Angela are sailing away on a sailboat, happily. Ferdinando states ""life begins at 40"" as the camera pans down, revealing Angela seductively rubbing her feet against the workman steering the boat.']"

Zane Ziminski  is found dead in a remote Eskimo community. It is believed that he died of a heart attack. His broadcast to the world about the aliens is believed to have been a UFO hoax due to his dismissal from NASA . As his death is announced on TV, five people receive envelopes with details of an alien invasion. This group of five consists of three scientists, Zane\'s step brother Jack Addison, a computer expert whom he has not seen in seven years, and a reporter named Bridget Riordan. They receive papers talking of global warming and of aliens terraforming Earth into a planet hot like their own dying world. The group gets together in a large freezer  to see what Zane has left them. They find some alien artifacts in an envelope left to the group. One of the five suffers from the cold and is revealed as an alien. He sets off a metal sphere . The alien and one of the men are sucked into the BHB\'s area of influence as well as the contents of the room but Addison, Riordan and Zarcoff manage to escape. Zarcoff in his hotel room is killed by an alien metal spider machine which injects him, making it look like his death was from a heart attack. Addison goes back to his rooms to find a BHB has cleared them of everything. A girl he picked up and slept with last night turns out to be an alien and she and another alien inject Addison and he later wakes up to find himself being ""taken for a ride"". Addison rolls out of the car and despite terrible disorientation manages to elude them and team up with Riordan again. The aliens have set the FBI on the two  as well as cancelling their credit cards and emptying Addison\'s bank account of $15,000. The pair have only one artifact left and that produces a perfect 3D hologram when a laser beam is shone through it. They use it to find out that an atomic power plant due to be opened near where they are in Quebec is in the hands of the aliens. Later it is revealed that it is to go critical and will spread deadly radiation over many hundreds of miles . An attempt with a better laser fails as an alien tries to frame them for murder and then they find another one at a facility. Addison uses his computer skills to walk around and interact with an alien ship in space and to program a giant BHB to go off in one hour. The aliens arrive and both are captured from the hologram. In the atomic power station, their time seems to be up till the giant BHB goes off in the alien area below it and starts ripping apart and swallowing the atomic power station. Nearly dragged into its sphere of influence, Addison uses a small BHB to stop the giant one long enough for the two to escape. They just make it as all that is left of the power station is a huge hole in the ground. Some time later, Riordan\'s book Alien Agenda  is still top of the Science Fiction and NY Times best seller lists after 2 months. The world seems to still consider it all fiction. The film ends with the married couple driving to Alaska and it is just beginning to snow as they cross the border, which suits them fine.', 'The film begins with the crew of a spaceship seeing explosions in space and asteroids flying by. They are afraid that they are going to be hit, but their ship\'s computer, named Wiz, tells them that they were seeing the ""refraction"" of an event that took place millions of years ago. Overjoyed, the ship\'s crew hug and kiss each other. Next follows a scene within the Orion space complex  of Captain Mike Hamilton\'s slapping a fellow officer. Soon he is called to report on this behavior to the base commander. He says that the other officer did not give him a command personally, but told him to follow the directions of a computer. Hamilton\'s attitude against such machines is one of the few themes of the story. A scene derived from 2001: A Space Odyssey next appears. Hamilton and his ship, the MK-31, are sent to repair an automated satellite. One of the crew floats over to the satellite and starts work. Viewing this on the screen, Hamilton is upset because it is required that spacewalkers work in teams of two, and predicts that the acid in the battery will eat through the astronaut\'s suit. The astronaut says that he\'s in control of the situation - but it does start to eat through his suit. Hamilton himself goes to rescue the continually screaming astronaut, whose life is saved. Next comes a scene derived from Barbarella. A couple of astronauts wish to be intimate so they recline on separate beds while a light show machine plays between them. The blue orb that separates them has the same geometric shape as the Death Star in the Star Wars series. Normally this would appear to be an homage, but this film came out the same year as Star Wars . This scene is intercut with a scene of Hamilton telling a female crewmember that he doesn\'t like this mechanized intimacy and kisses her. The scene ends with her telling him that the old-fashioned way was better. Even though the crew of the MK-31 are only one day\'s travel from their shore leave on Earth, they are apparently the nearest ship to investigate an unstable planet. Once there, two flying saucers are seen orbiting it. The sensors of the ship state that these alien machines have ""disintegrators"" and Hamilton commands that they be destroyed - but they strike first and the MK-31 starts to spin quickly. Eventually Hamilton gets the ship\'s engines to counteract the spin and the ship lands on the planet. There\'s an architectural portal on this desert planet which teleports people who walk through it underground. The first man through it, and a woman who wanders away later, get attacked, but the main body of explorers meet a race of green people who have pointed ears. Their elder says that they are under the control of an evil computer. The astronauts pledge to help the inhabitants of the planet escape their enslavement and succeed in destroying the computer. Hamilton dislikes the computer always taunting the crew by ending his commands to them with the vocative, ""earthlings."" Unfortunately, the ensuing explosion takes out the planet as well. The spaceship crew and one surviving alien set off for Earth only to face further difficulties when a human member of the crew is possessed by the computer and goes on a killing spree. The alien eventually manages to subdue him, heroically sacrificing his own life. Although the crew are pleased at returning to Earth, the voice of the computer Wiz changes to that of the planet\'s computer, who ends the movie with the word ""earthlings.""', ""A group of technicians and scientists are called on to investigate the power shortage at a top-secret mining facility, located in the middle of nowhere. The facility, once a uranium mine, laboratory, and refinery, has been a site for radioactive dumping and top-secret experiments. They are unable to reach anyone at the facility, and when they land, no one is around. Three go to the control room to try and reboot the system, while the other three decide to form a small search party in hopes of finding the missing crew. They find the break room completely ransacked and covered in blood, however they do manage to find a teenage boy named Jesse, in a catatonic state from shock, apparently hiding from something. They take him back to the computer control center and demand answers from Major Tom McQuade, the head of the mission, who evades their questions. When they demand to leave, he refuses and orders them back to work, despite their continuing problems with the communications equipment. The main crew heads down to a lower level to investigate the situation while the pilot, Galloway and computer expert Moses stay in the control center with Jesse. On the lower level, the crew gets more and more suspicious but McQuade continues to act as if he knows nothing. The crew finds a huge tooth which seems to bother him. Then something almost drags a horrified McQuade down a tunnel. The crew goes from puzzled to completely horrified and runs, bent on escape, realizing that McQuade had been up to something after all. In the computer center, Jesse freaks out at the screams coming from the radio from the search party, as he knows what is posing a danger to the crew. Moses hears a strange sound and looks up to see a Velociraptor, which viciously attacks him, brutally beating and ripping him apart. Galloway returns to see the attack and flees, heading for the helicopter, where the rest of the crew decides to follow her, deciding to abandon the mission while they still can save themselves. Galloway starts up the helicopter, and waits anxiously for the rest of the crew to arrive, but she is suddenly attacked from behind by one of the raptors. Galloway frantically attempts to fend off the dinosaur, losing control of the chopper in the process. The helicopter crashes and explodes, leaving no possibility of escape, and leaving the crew virtually hopeless. With nothing left, they decide to go back inside and wait out the situation by taking refuge in the control room. There, they finally learn of the dinosaur's origins from McQuade: a brilliant genetic scientist working for a poultry company goes mad and decides to wipe out all of humanity by using a virus made from prehistoric DNA to impregnate the birds with dinosaurs. She later decides to make the virus for humans. The government narrowly contained the situation, but kept some of the eggs for analysis, storing them in the plant to be hidden. Unfortionately, the eggs hatched and killed off the entire crew, therefore putting the plant in danger of a meltdown. Left with no choice, McQuade organized the mission to prevent the meltdown and save the dinosaurs for research. Using dynamite, the group decides to try and seal off the lower levels to keep anymore dinosaurs from getting in, leaving McQuade and Rawlins behind with Jesse. McQuade chases after them, knocking out Monk, but is beaten after a brief fight. McQuade finally explains that he was trying to stop them from going into the facility's lower levels, because it contains massive amounts of nuclear radiation, waste, and warheads in the lower levels, and it is a nuclear hot spot because the nuclear waste is leaking. Jesse comes up with the idea of crashing the computers to send the site into emergency mode, which should get an evacuation squad to come and rescue them. Once Jesse is able to get the code and the plan is put into place, the group begins making its way back to the surface. They continue using dynamite to hold off any dinosaurs while getting to the elevator. While they are going up, a raptor gets on top of the elevator and manages to pull Rawlins out of it. In a particularly graphic scene, the raptor rips off Rawlins' arm and then splitting open her stomach, pulling her bowels to eat, while the others have to listen to her agonizing process to death. Monk and McQuade get injured so they stay behind with the dynamite, blowing themselves up along with the raptors that are on their tail. Jesse and Jack, now on their own, continue making their way to the surface. They run into a large Tyrannosaurus, but manage to escape in an elevator. Jack, however, has taken a long fall and is injured. Jesse runs outside to find the evacuation team waiting. He tries to get them to go back for Jack, but they refuse, so he runs back in himself. He manages to retrieve Jack and get him outside to the rescue helicopter, just as the T-Rex busts outside and bites the head off one of the rescue crew. Jesse runs back again, getting behind the wheel of a forklift and impaling the creature, managing to push it to the bottom of the elevator shaft. Safe, Jesse joins Jack and the remaining evacuation crew, while he uses a remote detonator to detonate the rest of the dynamite, destroying the facility as the helicopter flies off into the sunrise.""]"

But because he dumped the containers and altered the schedule of those container shipments to the customer, he is killed. We are then taken underwater in the blue ocean as Sebastian  and his girlfriend Dani  are dive surfing with a model. We learn that the group own a snorkeling business that rents out equipment for clients. Sebastian doesn't want to do this line of work forever. For Sebastian, there are countless treasures in the ocean that he has been in search of for a long time but one that he has been searching for four years is the Spanish ship San Cristobal, which sank somewhere near the North Reef and is rumored to have sunk in the ocean with a lot of treasure. Sebastian believes that if he finds this treasure, this will give him and his girlfriend the opportunity to live a better life. Sebastian hangs out with his friend and employee Mace  and his girlfriend Kimi , Dani's best friend, who are a couple that have a difficult relationship because Mace tends to mess around with other women. While Mace and Kimi have a crazy relationship, Sebastian and Dani are very much in love. While at work, they are visited by Carlton  and Azra , a couple who wants to hire them for diving in the North Reef for a week because they are looking for the San Cristobal. Of course, Sebastian has been trying for several years to find it but Carlton happens to have a map which may lead them to the treasure. So, both Sebastian and Dani agree to help the couple. The four go on various diving expeditions to find treasure. We then get to see some of the beach life as all six individuals enjoy the beach. Dani, Kimi, Sebastian, and Mace get involved in separate beach volleyball competitions. Sebastian and Mace go against their main diving competitors, Avery  who dates a girl named Kelsey  who loves to lecture him when he gets into trouble by messing around with women. While at a club, a random guy hits on the women and grabs the arm of Azra, who quickly puts him in a headlock. This raises the first red flag for Dani who becomes suspicious. The following day, we learn that Carlton is not really looking for the San Cristobal. He actually helps big clients smuggle treasure to other locations. Both Carlton and Azra tell Sebastian and Dani that if they help them find the two containers, they will earn $500,000. Also, we learn that if Carlton doesn't find the containers in a week, the men will kill them. The reason why he is willing to pay them a lot of money is part of an apology because the men who hired him know the names of Sebastian and Dani and their lives are in danger too. So, now both Sebastian and Dani are forced to help Carlton and Azra find the two containers but while they are at sea, Avery takes notice and he starts looking to find whatever they are looking for. With their lives threatened, Dani convinces Sebastian that they must look to see what is in those containers and why their lives are being threatened. Something terrible could be in those containers and that they need to check them without bringing Carlton and Azra along. Thus, the two take their boat out to sea late at night to dive and see what those containers are. What they find in the containers are not treasure but a bomb. When they return from their boat after the dive, they are greeted by Carlton and Azra, who have been hiding in their boat and are ready to kill them. Carlton tells him that in container one there is the casing and in container two there is a nuclear warhead. One without the other is useless but together it creates a powerful weapon. Their goal is to create a second Pearl Harbor. Dani jumps off the boat to try and get help. She is found in the morning one mile off shore and is put in the hospital. Azra tries to kill her but she runs away and a chase ensues. Meanwhile, Sebastian and Mace try to bring up the containers for Carlton. Mace purposely messes up and Kimi is killed. Sebastian and Mace rebel, ending in Carlton and his bodyguard dead. Dani outruns Azra and Azra kills her boss so she can disappear again. Dani, Sebastian, and Mace reunite. They then have Kimi's funeral. The movie concludes six months later where Sebastian and Mace find the San Cristobal and buy their someday boat."", 'The lifelong feud between Max  and John  has cooled; they continue to call each other ""moron"" and ""putz"", only now with affection. Their children, Melanie  and Jacob , have become engaged after a brief relationship. Meanwhile, John is enjoying his marriage to wife Ariel , which occurred at the end of the first film. The spring and summer fishing season is also in full swing in Wabasha, Minnesota, with the annual quest to catch ""Catfish Hunter"", the lake\'s largest catfish, consuming the fishing community. However, the local bait shop closed after the death of its proprietor Chuck in the first film. New arrival to Wabasha, Maria Ragetti , has purchased the building with the intent of converting it into a fancy Italian restaurant. Max and John join forces to try to sabotage the restaurant and succeed to a point, enough to make Ariel force John to go over to the restaurant and apologize to Maria for what he\'s done. Originally, John doesn\'t want to do it, and is encouraged by Max to tell Ariel so, which results in John moving in with Max as Ariel throws him out of the house. John eventually breaks down, and goes to apologize to Maria after realizing that Max lives a slovenly  lifestyle at his home. Things go awry, however, when John and Maria trade shots of grappa over the conversation. He tells her that he\'s happily married with Ariel for six months. Maria mentions that her marriage with Antonio ended badly before it began. Eventually, John drinks too much and passes out, waking up the next morning in the restaurant, leading Ariel and Max to believe that the two slept together. However, Maria\'s mother Francesca  stops the confrontation by revealing three things; the first is that she and John\'s father are in a relationship, Maria has no interest in John and is in fact infatuated with Max, to everyone\'s surprise. While out in his boat one day Max finds Maria on the lake fishing, and the shared interest helps to begin a romance between the two. However, Maria calls it off, thanks to Francesca reminding her of five failed marriages in the past, and Max is bewildered and disappointed. To complicate things further, Jacob and Melanie\'s wedding plans are causing the couple stress because of their fathers\' apparent inability to plan a proper wedding. After John decides to book ""Handsome Hans"", Wabasha\'s ""polka king"" for the wedding, Melanie finally snaps and she and Jacob get into a huge argument, which results in the wedding being called off and the two to live separately. Upon hearing the news, John and Max call off their truce and reignite their feud. Once again, Max and John resort to childish pranks to get back at each other, which include: Max broadcasting a video of John sitting still, naked, for a statue Ariel was making of him, Max disconnecting John\'s outboard motor, John cutting Max\'s fishing net and boat anchor line, and John\'s cat Slick spending the night inside Max\'s truck clawing the ""authentic imitation leather"" on the seats. This leads to the climax of the feud. Max adopts a one-eyed bulldog named Lucky, who chases Slick into John\'s house, messing up the house, and causing the statue of John to break. Seeing the destruction of the statue, Ariel moves out, telling John she isn\'t coming back until the two are done fighting. In addition, Max had another date scheduled for Maria, but her mother will not let her go because Maria has been heartbroken five times in her past marriages and she fears that Max will make it six. Maria does not show up for their date and Max tries in vain to get in contact with her. Saddened over Ariel leaving and moving in with Melanie, John goes to the lake to fish with his father  and get some advice of what to do about what had just happened. However, Grandpa has died on the couch he used to fish on. At his funeral, his ashes are scattered in the lake, in front of everyone. Max and John call off their feud again when they bond over John\'s father. The two also help Jacob and Melanie reunite after their brief estrangement and the wedding is apparently back on. Before leaving to reconcile with Ariel, John convinces Max to try again with Maria, telling him to ""park that stupid pride of his"" and tell her how he really feels. Max decides to visit Maria at Ragetti\'s. Max stops to see Maria, but her mother refuses to let him in. He doesn\'t give up and comes in anyway by telling Francesca that he refuses to leave until he sees her. Maria doesn\'t want to see him, but she eventually comes out. She comes clean by telling Max the truth on how many times she\'s actually been married. He was only aware of one marriage, to a man named Antonio and could be implied that John told him about it. Max decides then to explain to Maria he\'s not like the other 5 men she was with and that he knows how to treat a lady. In telling her how he truly feels, the two rekindle their romance. Much like the first film, a wedding is to take place at the end. On the way to the wedding, however, Max and John see a fellow fisherman named Sven, who has come in contact with Catfish Hunter and is staggering around bewildered after being unable to catch him. Max convinces John that they should take one more try at catching the fish, considering his boat is nearby. John agrees, and the two set out to catch Catfish Hunter in spite of all the damage John did to Max\'s boat earlier in the film. The two manage to reel in the large catfish and have him in the boat, but John says that they should throw him back. Max thinks he\'s nuts, but John reminds him that his father had been trying to catch Catfish Hunter for twenty years, and the two should be in the lake together. Therefore, Catfish Hunter is returned to the lake and the duo rushes to the church for the wedding, which turns out to be Max\'s wedding to Maria . Max and Maria are wed and drive away in the limousine to their reception to be held at Maria\'s restaurant, which will also serve as the town\'s bait shop again. As in the first film, a trick is played on the newlyweds in the limo on the way to the reception. Max and Maria were kissing and looked up to see Lucky looking back. They are startled at first, but realized that they\'re smelling Lucky. John had put the dog in the front seat to stink up the limo as revenge for the prank Max pulled on him with a dead fish.', '{{Plot}} Jim Hawkins, a young boy living with his mother in England in their inn, the \'Admiral Benbow\', is looking after the inn, when a strange man comes and orders a glass of rum from him, at the same time asking Jim if he has seen a ""Captain William Bones"". Jim answers that he has never seen a Billy Bones, and gets Black Dog another glass of rum. However, Black Dog looks into the back of the inn and sees an old sea chest with the initials ""W.B."" inscribed on the side, and takes off. Once he is gone, Bones enters asking Jim if it was ""a one legged man"". Jim tells Bones of the man who came in and Bones recognizes him as Black Dog, and tells Jim to give him rum, though he is instructed not to for his health sake. Jim runs out of the inn, but runs straight into Blind Pew and is caught. Pew presents Bones with the infamous black spot, and leaves. Bones reveals he has until dark to live, but he is too ill to walk even a few steps, so knowing he is going to die, he gives Jim a roll of paper and tells him to go get help from the town. The pirates come to the inn and begin to ransack it in search of whatever it is they are after. A carriage comes down the road and they flee, chased by some men on horseback, while the carriage stops at the inn with Squire Trelawney, Doctor Livesey, and Jim. They find Bones, and Livesey declares him dead, but from shock, not murder. Jim reveals that Bones gave him something that he said the pirates were after. It is the map of Captain John Flint\'s treasure . Trelawney, overly excited, makes plans then and there for a voyage, with Livesey as ship\'s doctor and Jim as cabin boy. Ten days pass. Jim arrives and Doctor Livesey rendezvous with Squire in Bristol Dock. After showing them their ship, the Hispaniola, Trewlaney states that he is troubled by the fact that their captain is having trouble selecting a crew. He then introduces them to a man whom he hired as ship\'s cook, named Long John Silver. The three sit down at Silver\'s tavern to have a meal, and they see Silver has only one leg. Jim is at first frightened by this,  but Silver seems kind and civil, stating that he was once in the navy, and volunteers to bring some of his former shipmates aboard the voyage, since they ""know the sea"". Silver introduces Jim to his pet parrot, Captain Flint, who is an avid swearer and ""Lives up to her name"". Jim then hears a voice behind him ordering a glass of rum, and he turns around to see Black Dog. The buccaneer flees before he can be caught. Silver then gives Jim a small pistol, just his size. Silver, Jim and Silver\'s former crew mates board the Hispaniola to prepare for the voyage. Captain Smollett then speaks privately with Livesey and Trelawney, stating how displeased he is with the fact that this whole voyage is a treasure hunt. Trelawney swears that he never breathed a word about the treasure, but Livesey asks the captain if he is worried about a mutiny, to which he doubts. He then toasts the voyage with the two, and when he leaves, Trelawney dubs his conduct, ""Downright un-English!"". Once the voyage is well underway, one of the crew, George Merry, is found to carrying a concealed weapon. Jim feels guilty about hiding the small pistol that Silver gave him, but Silver says that as long as he doesn\'t do any harm with it, that he is responsible enough to keep it on his person. Silver then goes over to George and reminds George that Mr. Arrow is a friend and that he will take care of him. That night, there is a storm, in which Silver invites Mr. Arrow in to eat plum duff, a cake made with rum. Once Silver leaves the room, Arrow, being an avid drinker, drinks down the entire bottle that Silver left behind, while Silver secretly watches. Soon afterward, Mr. Arrow emerges from the galley, clearly drunk, and the next morning, a funeral is held for Mr. Arrow, who had been washed overboard. Time passes, and Jim is seen talking to Hunter at the helm about when they will sight land. Hunter mentions that when the last apple has been eaten, that they will sight land. Jim excitedly states that he plans to eat up all the apples, and runs below deck to do so. Once he arrives below deck, he climbs inside to grab one, and at that moment, he overhears the crew talking about their plans to mutiny, and learns that Silver is the ringleader. Silver convinces the men to wait until they have the treasure on board the ship to strike, and begins to reach into the barrel Jim is hiding in, but Jim is saved by the cry ""Land Ho!"" from above deck, and the mutineers run up to see for themselves. Jim then leaves the barrel and runs to the cabin to warn the captain, squire and doctor. They arrange for Jim to be their spy. The next day, Silver tells Jim about all the excitement he will have exploring the island, though he can tell that Jim is withdrawing from him slightly.Silver offers to guide the ship into anchorage, and Jim asks if he can go with Silver. Smollett allows him, knowing the boy might learn something of the pirate\'s plan. While the boat is in the water, George Merry, impatient and wanting to take charge himself, tells the other mutineers to attack, but they are cornered and sent below deck. Silver gives orders for the men in the two boats with him to run for it, and uses Jim as a hostage to keep Smollett and the others from firing, telling them to give up the map in exchange for Jim\'s life. Upon reaching the shore, Jim jumps from the boat and runs off into the jungle. After evading pursuit from three of the mutineers, Jim encounters and befriends Ben Gunn, one of Flint\'s crew who was marooned on the island five years ago. Jim tells him about the mutiny, and then Ben takes Jim to a fort, where he finds the captain and his friends, who abandoned the ship and came ashore in order to rescue Jim. Silver and his men go back aboard ship to get the muskets from the cabin, and find the rest of their men drinking the rum stores. Silver plans to punish George, but Israel says that George would be better in helping them take the stockade, and Silver allows George\'s rash actions to slide. Silver appears outside the stockade with a flag of truce. Silver gives him terms, stating that he will let them all live in exchange for the map. Smollett does not accept, and Silver leaves, stating, ""Them that die will be the lucky ones!"" Most of the pirates fall and are badly injured in the fight, but Silver shots Smollet, wounding him badly before he too, makes a retreat. That night, Livesey gives Jim the map, telling him that if they are captured, to use the map to buy his life with. Smollett then reveals that the pirates may not attack again because of the possibility of them bringing the ship close into shore at flood tide the next morning, allowing them to put the fort within range and kill them all. Jim sneaks out with a knife and uses Ben Gunn\'s boat to make his way out to the ship. Once there, he cuts the anchor rope and climbs aboard. He sees a fight between Israel Hands and another mutineer over rum, and sees Israel stab his companion in the back. Israel then attempts to fire the cannon, but he is heavily drunk and tired from the fight, so Jim easily knocks him away from the cannon, but Israel chases him into the rigging. Jim pulls out the pistol Silver gave him, and Israel throws a knife at Jim and it sticks in his arm, but Jim fires the pistol reflexively and shoots Israel in the face. Jim then lowers the Jolly Roger flag, and raises the English Union Jack. He then makes his way ashore and back to the stockade, his knife wound slowly and painfully becoming infected due to the swampy region he makes his way through. Finally, he arrives back at the stockade and attempts to wake Livesey to tend to his wound, but it turns out to Long John Silver that he has awoken. Jim faints due to both fright and exhaustion. Silver is clearly worried, and while searching for more wounds on the boy, discovers the map, and hides it on his person as his comrades awaken. Though the mutineers  want to let Jim die, Silver states they can use Jim to bargain with Livesey and the others for the map. The crew is displeased with this decision, and step outside to vote on what should be done. Silver then hails Livesey by calling out from the top of the fort, and sees that the ship has been taken. Livesey responds and Silver\'s crew reveal that they are giving him the black spot. When Silver reads it, he notices that it has been cut from a Bible and berates them for doing something so foolish, then states that the rest of this business will be decided once he finishes the business with the map. Silver takes Jim out to Livesey, who tends to his wound. Silver tells him that he saved Jim\'s life and that he saw the ship and knows he\'s beat, though Livesey did not know the ship had been taken until Silver told him, and realizes what Jim has done for them. Silver reveals that he found the map on Jim\'s person, telling Jim that he cares about him enough to save his life even though he already had it. Silver makes a deal with Livesey for freedom if he guards Jim while he and his men search for the treasure. Silver walks back to his men and shows them the map, who are elated with the results of the negotiation, but Silver resigns as captain. The men insist he keeps his position, and he gives them back the black spot to put back into the Bible they took it from. The pirates then go hunting for the treasure, and on the way, discover a skeleton of one of their former mates on Flint\'s ship. After using the bones, which were laid out by compass as a pointer, they make their way to the treasure, where they find it has already been dug up and taken. The pirates are angered that the treasure is gone, and Silver tells Jim to ""Standby for trouble."" George Merry accuses Silver of making a deal with Doctor Livesey, and attempts to shoot him, but Silver fires first and kills George. Silver shoots down the pirates one by one, until Livesey and Trelawney arrive with the others and ambush them, shooting them all down. Jim is reunited with his friends, and Ben Gunn gives back Silver\'s crutch, which he had thrown at one of the pirates. Ben reveals that he found Flint\'s gold a long time ago and hid it in his cave, where he takes Jim and Silver to see for themselves. Smollett, almost completely recovered from his wound, and despite Jim\'s defense of Silver, orders Silver to be taken aboard the ship and put in irons. Once on the beach with some loaded treasure and new supplies, Jim, Trelawney and two men are ready to take Silver aboard the ship, where suddenly, Silver snatches the small pistol from Jim\'s belt and orders Trelawney and the two men to swim for it or he will shoot. He forces Jim to stay in the boat to man his rudder while he rows, but Jim beaches him on a small sandbar and gets out. Silver raises a pistol, but Jim says he won\'t take orders from Silver, who takes aim, but Silver drops the pistol. Silver attempts to push himself off the bank and Jim rushes over to help push out the boat. Silver thanks him and rows away to freedom just as Livesey and the others arrive to try to catch him. Silver turns back to shout back to Jim, bidding him goodbye and wishing him good luck. Livesey curses Silver, and at the same time, wishes him the best of luck, while Jim, who realizes that Silver was his friend all along, raises his hand and waves goodbye to him. The film then closes with Long John Silver sailing off into the horizon.']"

Clélia\'s mother once dated MacRoi years ago while working as a caberet singer. Once she became pregnant with Clélia, she stopped seeing MacRoi and married Clélia\'s father. Accompanying her daughter to Paris, she tells Clélia that her strongest principle was honour, and encourages her to get married and settle down. In Paris Clélia gives a television interview and talks about her two successful books of photography: a ""study of absence"" showing empty streets and deserted landscapes, and a study of fashion models without showing their faces. While walking the Paris streets taking photographs, Clélia meets Clève , a bumbling middle-aged children\'s book publisher who is preparing to marry MacRoi\'s wealthy daughter to bolster his flagging publishing house. Clève is immediately attracted to Clélia and invites her back to his office where they make love. Afterwards, she meets Clève\'s brother Bernard, a Catholic bishop, and their father. At the La Verite offices, Clélia finds most of her co-workers to be disillusioned and perverse—all knowing that they ""earn their keep on dirt."" At her first assignment covering a hockey team that MacRoi recently purchased, Clélia finds herself in the team\'s locker room surrounded by naked players celebrating their victory. MacRoi is there and after teasing her about her taking photos of the naked players asks if she\'ll join his family for a dinner party. Before she leaves, Clélia has sex with one of the players. At MacRoi\'s dinner party, Clève loudly declares his love for Clélia before his entire family, including his fiance, Genièvre MacRoi, the sister of Rupert MacRoi. Genièvre responds by calling off their wedding and hitting him. Later that evening, following MacRoi\'s announcement of the purchase of Clève\'s publishing company, Clève\'s father collapses and dies while his son and Clélia look on. Clève asks Clélia never to leave him. At the funeral, Clève confides in Clélia his fears that MacRoi will not respect his family\'s publishing house now that he owns it, saying, ""He massacres all that is upright and inneficient, delicate and noble."" Soon after, Clélia and her mother move into Clève\'s house. He gives her his mother\'s engagement ring. In bed she reads lines from a W. H. Auden poem, ""This like a dream keeps other time, and daytime is the loss of this, for time is inches and the heart\'s changes, where ghost has haunted lost and wanted. But this was never a ghost\'s endeavor, nor finished this, was ghost at ease, and till it pass love shall not near the sweetness here nor sorrow take his endless look."" Clélia\'s first portfolio of photos for La Verite creates a sensation and she is congratulated by her colleagues—all except Némo , a sexy young photographer who promptly propositions her upon their first encounter. In spite of her sexual attraction to Némo, Clélia marries Clève in a ceremony marred somewhat by the presence of La Verite photographers and reporters, including Némo. After the wedding, Némo leaves his girlfriend, Ina , a former African princess and Parisian prostitute whom he met investigating the illegal organ trade. He delivers his wedding photos to Clélia\'s home, handing them to her mother. Upset at the intrusion, and suspecting her daughter is having an affair, Clélia\'s mother collapses and soon dies. Némo continues to follow Clélia, even taking photos of her in her house making love to her husband. Later she learns that Némo was given this assignment by MacRoi who is looking to find dirt on Clève. Although she continues to see Némo, Clélia resolutely keeps to her wedding vows in the face of her suitor\'s continued advances. She travels by train to Normandy to attend a motorcycle event in which Némo is a participant. During the race Némo crashes, and Clélia rushes to his side, revealing her feelings for him. At the celebration afterwards, Némo gets drunk and loud, talking about his investigation into the illegal organ trade and the shady International characters involved. Later that night he and Clélia take the train back to Paris together. After Némo is attacked by a gang hired by the illegal organ traffickers, Clélia asks him to show her the world he is investigating—a dark world of brutal human fighting to the death. Throughout their time together, Némo continues his advances toward her, but Clélia resists. When she returns to her home, Clève is convinced she is having an affair, despite her promises that she\'s never lied to him and will never be unfaithful to him. After learning that his brother the bishop has run off with a married woman, Clève says he will join his brother in Plougastel-Daoulas in Brittany at The Happy Inn. After they make love Clève writes on the bathroom mirror, ""Oh but what worm am I the victim of that you then unabashed did what I never wished confessed another love and I submissive, felt unwanted and went out?"" After he leaves, Clélia calls the offices of La Verite to inform them of Bishop Bernard\'s ""love-nest"" in Brittany, and soon the scandal erupts in the news. Clélia watches the television coverage of his public humiliation. Clève does not return to his wife, and after sleeping with a transvestite prostitute, he calls La Verite asking that they track his wife who he believes is two-timing him. Meanwhile, Clélia comes to Némo\'s house, where assassins hired by the organ traffickers blast the place with gunfire, but Némo and Clélia are able to defend themselves and escape. Soon after, Clélia attends a publicity session with MacRoi and a new partner. MacRoi presents Némo with a new expensive motorcycle for his work covering Clélia. During the session, assassins again attempt to kill Némo, and during the attack both Némo and Clève are injured. MacRoi is killed by a shard of glass in his eye. After the funeral, MacRoi\'s daughter reorganizes the company, intending to continue the scandal-mongering. She also fires Clélia, who later begs her husband to come back to her, but he will not reconsider. On their way out of the building he falls down a flight of steps and dies on the way to the hospital, with Clélia at his side. At the funeral she avoids Némo\'s advances and leaves Paris. Sometime later, Némo is interviewed on television and talks about his new portfolio dedicated to Clélia, who has disappeared. A few years later, while taking photographs in a monastery, Clélia by chance sees the beginning of an English-language MacRoi Production film called The Princess of Cleve about her life, directed by Némo. She laughs at the absurdity. Before leaving the monastery, she places her wedding rings on a tree branch, while the ghost of her late husband looks on. Clélia can only say, ""Forgive me."" He smiles and retrieves the rings while she weeps.', 'The film\'s narrative structure is a largely non-linear series of key events from the life of Édith Piaf, many of which the audience ultimately learns are evoked as flashbacks from within Édith\'s own memory as she dies. Despite the fractured narrative approach, the film is anchored at the beginning by predominance of elements from her childhood, and at the end with the events prior to and surrounding her death, poignantly juxtaposed by a performance of her song, ""Non, je ne regrette rien"" . The film opens with Édith as a small child in 1918, crying on a stoop after being teased by other children on the streets of Paris. Her mother stands across the alley singing, busking for change. Édith\'s mother writes to her child\'s father, the acrobat, who is fighting in the trenches of World War I battlefields, informing him that she is leaving Édith with her mother so she can pursue the life of the artist. Her father returns to Paris and scoops up a sick Édith, then in turn leaves the child with his own mother, who is a madam of a bordello in Normandy. Now living as a child in a brothel, surrounded by the often brutal and demeaning business of prostitution, Édith is taken under the wing of the women there, especially Titine , a young troubled redhead who becomes emotionally attached to the little girl. Titine sings to, plays with, and tenderly cares for Édith through travails including an episode of keratitis-induced blindness that is healed through their prayers to St. Thérèse. Years later, Édith\'s father returns for her. Despite anguished protests from both Titine and Édith, he takes the child away to join him as he works as a circus acrobat. As Édith is outside cleaning up after dinner one night, she watches a fire eater practicing, and in the flames sees an apparition of St Thérèse, who assures her that she will always be with her—a belief that she carries with her for the rest of her life. When Édith is nine years old, her father leaves the circus after an argument with the manager and begins performing on the streets of Paris. During a lackluster performance of her father\'s contortionist skills while Édith holds a hat for coins, a passerby asks if Édith is part of the show and, with prompting by her father to ""do something"" so the half-interested audience doesn\'t leave, she spontaneously sings ""La Marseillaise"" with raw emotion, mesmerizing the street crowd. Years later, a nightclub owner named Louis Leplée  approaches Édith while she sings  on the streets of Montmartre for supper money with her friend Mômone. He invites her to his club for an informal audition. Impressed, he hires her, after creating for diminutive Édith a stage surname of Piaf, a colloquialism for sparrow. Soon, Leplée is shot dead, suspected by the police to be due to Édith\'s connections to the mafia through the pimp who has demanded a large portion of her street singing earnings. When Édith next attempts a show at a low grade cabaret, she is jeered and shouted off the stage by a hostile crowd, but she soon meets her next mentor—Raymond Asso, a songwriter and accompanist. He enlivens her performances by teaching her to gesture with her ""great hands"" while singing, and works with her on enunciation and other aspects of stage presence, including how to battle her initial fierce bouts of stage fright that almost prevent her from taking the stage for her first music hall performance. While performing in New York City, Édith meets Marcel Cerdan , a fellow French national who is a boxer competing for the World Champion title. Though she quickly learns from him that he has a wife, who runs their pig farm while he\'s away, Édith tells Mômone that she is falling in love with Marcel. The affair that ensues, while supposedly secret, results in the playing of ""La Vie En Rose"" being played for Marcel wherever he goes. The morning after Édith has persuaded Marcel to fly to her from Paris to join her in New York, she wakes up to his kiss. She joyfully hurries to get him coffee and her gift to him of a watch, while she mocks and exasperatedly shouts at her oddly subdued entourage as they listlessly stand around her apartment. They finally break the news to her that Marcel\'s plane crashed. Édith hysterically searches for the ghost of Marcel that was lounging on her bed just a few moments before, crying out the name of her lost lover. The narrative bookends these scenes from Édith\'s middle life with repeated vignettes of an aged-looking Édith with frizzy red hair, being nursed and tended to. She spends much of her time sitting in a chair by the lakeside, and when she stands, she has the stooped posture and slowness of a much older person. Another set of fractured memories shows Édith with short curly hair, plastered to her face like she is feverish, singing on stage and collapsing while she tries to sing, a moment when Édith herself realizes that her body is betraying her, when she is hosting a party at a Parisian bistro, and topples a bottle of champagne because of her developing arthritis, and to the morphine addiction that ultimately plays a large role in her demise, as she injects the drug with a young lover in her bedroom. After her husband persuades her to enter rehabilitation for her addiction, she travels to California with him, Jacques Pills, and the audience sees the sober but manic-by-nature Édith being driven around in a convertible, laughing, joking, teasing her compatriots and generally being the life of the party, until she takes the wheel and promptly drives into a joshua tree. The hilarity is uninterrupted as Édith gets out and pretends to hitchhike—the whole episode appearing to be a metaphor for her lifelong frantic efforts to be happy and distracted by entertaining others, through all manner of disasters. Years later, Piaf, now frail and hunched, squabbles with her entourage about whether or not she will be able to perform at the Olympia. No one but Édith thinks that she will be ready to attempt the feat, but she ultimately faces this reality herself. Then, a new songwriter and arranger shows up with a song, ""Je ne regrette rien"", and Édith exclaims: ""You\'re marvelous! Exactly what I\'ve been waiting for. It\'s incredible. It\'s me! That\'s my life, it\'s me."" She announces that she will indeed perform it at the Olympia. Memories from prior to and during her last performance, when she collapses onstage, are interwoven through the film, foreshadowing the tragic end to a stellar but prematurely ended stage life. The memories appear to almost haunt Piaf. In one series, prior to what turns out to be her last performance, Édith is finally ready to go onstage after a series of delays, when she asks for the cross necklace that she always wears. As her staff rush away to get it, she sits and, in her quiet solitude, experiences more memories of her past, and after Édith puts on the retrieved cross and shuffles out onto the stage, the film presents more flashbacks as she is singing one of her signature songs, ""Je ne regrette rien."" She relives a sunny day on a beach with her knitting, when an older Édith with an obvious stoop graciously answers the simple and polite questions of an interviewer: what is her favorite color? , her favorite food? , and then more poignant questions that she also answers without hesitation, again showing the longings of her life. If you were to give advice to a woman, what would it be? ""Love."" To a young girl? ""Love."" To a child? ""Love."" As though he is carrying a swaddled infant, Louis easily carries Édith, tiny and wasted away at the age of 47, into her bedroom and tucks her into bed, while the subtitle removes any illusions that this is other than the last day of her life. She is afraid. She says she cannot remember things, but has a disjointed series of memories of the kind of small moments that somehow define all our lives more than the ""big moments"" do—scrambled and fragmentary as a dying person might experience—her mother commenting on her ""wild eyes,"" her father giving her a gift of a doll, and thoughts of her own dead child, Marcelle. The film ends not with a death scene, which is implied, but with Édith performing ""Non, je ne regrette rien"" at the Olympia.', '{{Plot}} Joan is shown being burned at the stake; however, it happens fast, as the flames quickly engulf her and she disappears. The plotline then tells the story of how she came to this. Ten years earlier, Joan, as a little girl, confesses her sins in church two or three times a day. The priest asks after her family; concluding all is well at home, he decides she is only unusually religious. She skips out of the church, glad to be forgiven by God and Jesus. Wandering away from her village, she has a somewhat violent and supernatural vision. She returns to find her village burning. Her sister, Catherine tries to protect her by hiding her inside a closet before the English arrive at their house. The Englishman sees Catherine and forces himself on her but she valiantly fights him off. Frustrated he takes out his sword and stabs her in her stomach, pinning her to the wall. Catherine\'s now lifeless body is further desecrated and raped repeatedly as Joan watches in horror. She survives the attack, and goes to live with her distant relatives; she confesses to the priest that she wants to forgive her enemies, as the Bible teaches, but she cannot. Many years later, at Chinon, the Dauphin and soon to be King of France Charles VII receives a message from Joan, requesting an army to lead into battle. Charles VII thinks he should let her come, but his advisers say she may be an assassin. The king\'s mother-in-law, Yolande of Aragon says Joan should be seen because the people believe she can save France from the English. Joan arrives at Chinon, and right away Charles VII is warned again that she could be an assassin. Charles VII comes up with the plan to let someone else pretend to be him; that way if she is an assassin she will kill the wrong man, and if she is truly sent by God she will know who the real future king is. Joan stands before the throne, but tells the man sitting there, the young Jean d\'Aulon, that he is a good man but is not Charles VII. The court chamberlain Trémoille, who had just earlier announced Jean d\'Aulon falsely as Charles VII, tells her that the real Dauphin is among the crowd and to go pick him out by herself. Walking slowly through the crowded room, she finds Charles VII in the corner; Charles\' three senior knights  put their daggers to her throat. Joan tells Charles ""I have a message from the King of Heaven for you, and you only"", and in a private audience, explaining her visions, declares that she is to lead the French Army to victory against the English, and predicts that only then will he become the King of France. The royal court, still reluctant to give Joan an army to command, wants additional proof that she has been sent by God. A specially appointed group of women first proceeds to verify her claim of maidenhood. The testing continues as they question whether her knowledge of warfare is good enough to command an army. To additional demands of extraordinary kinds of proof she replies that she did not come to perform tricks; the fact that she has travelled through enemy territory in her journey to Chinon without being killed should suffice. Joan, clad in armour and equipped with a long white banner, leads the French army to the besieged city of Orléans, which is under the military command of Jean de Dunois, the Bastard of Orleans. Joan arrives with her attendant Aulon and the senior knights the Duke of Alençon, Gilles de Rais and La Hire. Standing in front of a rough model of the city and its surroundings, Joan points to the Boulevard des Tourelles, suggesting an attack there. Dunois and the other senior knights say her plan is reckless and makes no sense, and Dunois even admits that they are not used to taking orders from a girl. An infuriated Joan slaps a chuckling La Hire and, with the help of Aulon, cuts her hair short like a man\'s. She has a letter to the English transcribed, politely requesting their surrender. The English Captain shouts out the response: ""Go fuck yourself!"" The commanders show their skepticism of Joan\'s leadership by starting next morning\'s battle for the stockade at St Loup without her. By the time she arrives on the battlefield, the French soldiers are already retreating. Furious at her soldiers\' disobedience, she ends the retreat and leads her army into another charge. Her horse leaps into the fort and she lowers the drawbridge, allowing her army to rush inside and take it. Afterwards, the French salvage an English trebuchet, to the delight of the French knight Xaintrailles, who claims it as his own. With the fort taken, they find the Tourelles, a small but impressive stronghold commanded by Sir William Glasdale, that will be much more difficult to take. Joan gives the English another chance to surrender, which they refuse. Dunois and the senior knights begin tactical planning in St. Augustins church, before the Tourelles fortifications. However, Joan hastily leads the French soldiers to the Tourelles, where the prepared English defenders inflict heavy casualties on the French attackers. While climbing a ladder to the fort, Joan gets shot in the chest with an arrow. The siege is brought to a halt by the order of an enraged Dunois; Joan pulls out the embedded arrow herself and collapses. The seriousness of her wounds causes great concern within the French army. She rises before the troops the next morning, and to their delight, leads them in a second attack. An English siege tower falls and the drawbridge is broken, granting access to the outer fort. An improvised battering ram of a cart filled with logs is brought to bear on the great door of the inner fort. They break in; amid the slaughter of the final stand, Joan has another vision, this one of Jesus screaming and bleeding violently from the head. Joan feels conflicted with the victory, uneasy about all the deaths that took place. She even prevents an English prisoner from being executed. The English army regroups on the other side of the river, and the French and English armies move to face each other on a large open grassy field. Joan rides alone towards the English and shouts out to them that this is their chance to surrender and return to England. English archers move forward, which prompts French archers to ready themselves. Mounted English knights then move forward, and then suddenly turn, and slowly ride away. The English infantry follow suit. The French cheer; Joan has freed Orléans. Informed of the victory, the Duke of Bedford, regent for the still under-aged King Henry VI of England, says he wants Joan of Arc burned. Joan returns to Reims to witness the solemn, splendid and emotional coronation of Charles VII of France. Her military campaigns continue to the walls of Paris. Her 10,000 reinforcements never arrive, and the siege to take back the city is a failure. She tells King Charles VII to give her another army, but he wants her only to go home, explaining that he now prefers diplomacy over warfare to achieving France\'s aims and that her services are therefore no longer required. Convinced by Yolande of Aragon that Joan has become a political nuisance, Charles conspires to get rid of Joan by letting her get captured by enemy forces. She is taken prisoner by the pro-English Burgundians at Compiègne. She briefly meets the Duke of Burgundy, who sells her to the English. When Joan is transferred to Rouen, a French city still under English occupation, a mysterious bearded man in black robes and hood, dubbed ""The Conscience"" in the script, suddenly appears, and as suddenly vanishes, after questioning her visions, her motivations, and beliefs. Charged with the serious religious crime of heresy, stemming from her dubious claim of receiving visions and signs from God, she appears in an ecclesiastical court proceeding that is clearly being forced upon the Christian church by the English occupational government. She refuses to take an oath, declaring it runs contrary to her beliefs. Her defiance causes uproar in the courtroom, and Pierre Cauchon, the Bishop of Beauvais, decides that the case should be heard privately. The English tells Cauchon that the church must quickly condemn and execute Joan for heresy because English soldiers are afraid to fight while she remains alive. The Bishop demurs, expressing his concern about the possibility of wrongfully condemning and executing a Christian girl who might have truly received visions and signs from God. Joan\'s ""Conscience"" appears in her cell and continues to question her. He shows her dramatizations of mundane circumstances leading to a sword appearing in a field, and then a miraculous evocation of a shining sword descending from the heavens to the strains of an invisible angelic choir and orchestra. Of all the possibilities, you chose this one, he says. About to be burned for heresy, Joan is distraught that she will be brought before God without having given her confession, and the Bishop Cauchon plays upon this, requiring that she signs a written recantation of her visions and signs from God before he can hear her confession. The ""Conscience"" tells Joan that she has just signed away God\'s existence and that she has abandoned God. The relieved Bishop shows the signed written recantation to the English and tells them that Joan can no longer be burned as a heretic and that now only the English government, and not the Church, can turn her into a martyr. The frustrated English devise another way to have Joan executed by the church instead of by them. English soldiers go into Joan\'s cell room, rip her clothes and give her men\'s clothing to wear. They tell Cauchon that she conjured a spell to make the new clothing appear, which suggests that she is an evil witch who must be burned immediately. Although suspecting that the English may have forced the new clothes on Joan, a disappointed Cauchon nonetheless abandons Joan to her fate, reneging on his promise to hear her confession. The ""Conscience"", however, offers to hear her last confession: her signs were only what she wanted to believe and were not sent by God; she had fought in the name of revenge for her sister\'s death; she admits that she had been selfish and cruel. Joan is slowly burned alive in the marketplace of Rouen.']"

She takes this prompt decision much to the chagrin of her father, an overbearing taxi driver. In exchange, he forces her to join him at work so she can learn the trade and earn a living. Her reconnection with the so-called ""Family"", the close-knit group of her father\'s co-workers, is initially uneventful. One of its members is Dani, Paz\'s childhood sweetheart and a young taxi apprentice about to be discharged from the military service. Upon meeting for the first time in many years, they rekindle their mutual attraction and start dating, much to the apparent satisfaction of Dani\'s mother Reme—a fellow cabbie who is having a secret affair with Paz\'s father. Reme\'s husband is a former taxi driver who, according to the explanations given to Paz, was shot by two drug dealers during a robbery. One of the shots left him paralyzed and the ""Family""\'s visits to him in the hospital are a staple in their common social life. Aside from Dani, Velasco and Reme, this group is completed by a shady individual named Calero and a thuggish brute nicknamed ""Niño"" who seems to act as an informal henchman of sorts for the former. Paz realizes Calero is a former cop even before being told so, and their mutual distrust is vivid and ever-increasing throughout the film. From the outset, it is made clear to the audience that the ""Family"" is in fact a neo-fascist death squad whose members use their cabs to abduct non-white, immigrant, LGTB and drug-addicted costumers with murderous intent. There is also some evidence of rudimentary tactics, e.g. using code words for each ""kind"" of victim in order to lure unwitting victims to the killing box. Dani has been recently groomed into the group and partakes in their activities, although it is made apparent to the audience that he does so reluctantly. The ""Family"" seems to be generally successful in its exploits: two murders are shown on-screen, as well as a raid on a Moroccan camp during which Dani accidentally kills a man. The film does show, however, one botched attack during which the victim manages to run away unharmed. It is left unclear whether or not the group is restricted to the core members shown onscreen. It is also left unclear whether the group\'s activities were prompted by the attack that crippled Dani\'s father or it was just a casual event that fuelled them further, or whether the version given to Paz was a lie and the attack was a direct result of the group\'s illegal pursuits. Their activities are spontaneous and seemingly not officially sanctioned, but there are ominous references by Calero to people ""up there"" who know and approve of the group\'s activities, leaving the door open to speculation on a wider conspiracy. Although initially ignorant of the actions and general demeanour of the ""Family"", Paz gradually finds out the truth through a series of details and coincidences, such as a profusion of fascist and pre-democratic antics and regalia, purportedly intimate family reunions attracting skinheads and other sinister individuals and ending in massive Roman salutes, casual bigoted remarks from her father and Dani  and a disturbing pattern of codenames or ""labels"" directed at different collectivities. Paz\'s unassuming and long-suffering mother seems increasingly distraught at the prospect of having Dani close to her daughter, and although Paz initially blames this on his general lack of education and ambition, it becomes increasingly clear that her mother knows more than she says about him and the whole group. Once confronted with the evidence, her disgust and adamant disapproval set up a chain of events leading to the climax. The paranoid and increasingly unstable Calero, who saw her as a potential liability to the group from the very beginning, now wishes to silence Paz at all costs. He shoots  her father when he tries to stop him, and confronts her and Dani in the Retiro Park, shooting Dani, and being shot to death by Paz seconds before he is about to finish him off. The camera pans over the park as she walks away with the injured Dani, and credits roll. The fate of the rest of the group is left undisclosed.', ""The story begins with the birth of the Tsarevich Alexei in the opulent surroundings of the Imperial Court. The Russo-Japanese War is on and Tsar Nicholas  is warned by Count Witte  and Grand Duke Nicholas  that the war is futile and costing too many lives. They also tell him that the Russian people want a representative government, health care, voting and workers' rights, but Nicholas wants to maintain the traditional autocracy left to him by his forefathers. Meanwhile, underground political parties led by Vladimir Lenin ([[Michael Bryant , Joseph Stalin  and Leon Trotsky ([[Brian Cox  have formed. Alexei is soon diagnosed with haemophilia. The Tsarina Alexandra  is frantic. A shy former German princess who is not highly thought of by the Russian royal court, she is isolated, but is befriended by Grigori Rasputin , a Siberian peasant who describes himself as a religious pilgrim or holy man. He has become a curiosity with some people at court. Later Alexandra calls upon him to help her pray for Alexei, and comes to believe in his healing, life-saving abilities. In a textile mill, working under ghastly conditions, the people are encouraged by their priest, Father George Gapon . He leads them, joined by many other peasant workers, in a clearly peaceful procession to the Winter Palace, intending to present a petition to the Tsar. Hundreds of soldiers stand ready in front of the palace; their commanding officer tells them to shoot up in the air, but he falls from his horse, there is a panic, and the soldiers proceed to fire randomly into the crowd. Nicholas has not been at the palace and is horrified when he hears of the massacre, but admits he wouldn't have granted the people's requests. ([[Bloody Sunday  Eight years later, on the 300th anniversary of Romanov rule, the family holidays at the Livadia Palace in the Crimea. Alexei  is a very lively little boy who is constantly prevented from leading a normal life. A close bond, however, exists between Alexei and his bodyguard/protector, the Russian Naval Sailor Nagorny . Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin , who succeeded Witte, has commissioned the Imperial Duma and granted some of the people’s requests in order to preserve the Russian Empire. Prime Minister Stolypin also presents Nicholas with police reports about Rasputin's dissolute behaviour, which is serving to give the Tsar a bad reputation. As a result, the Tsar dismisses Rasputin from the court. Alexandra demands his return. She knows Alexei’s haemophilia was inherited from her, and is racked with guilt. She is obsessed with the thought that only Rasputin can stop the bleeding attacks when they occur. The Tercentenary celebration occurs in a grand fashion with much partying and festivities, but takes a turn for the worse when Prime Minister Stolypin is shot at an opera performance in Kiev. Nicholas retaliates not only by uprooting the conspiracy and executing the killers, but also by closing the Duma and allowing police to terrorise the peasants and burn their homes. Alexei has a minor fall at the Spala Hunting Lodge, which leads to his worst internal bleeding attack yet. It is presumed that he will die. The Tsaritsa writes a letter to Rasputin, who soon responds with words of comfort and confidence. Sure enough, the Tsarevich recovers, and Rasputin is allowed to return. World War I begins a few weeks after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, part of Austria-Hungary. Germany declares war on Russia immediately after Nicholas has ordered the mobilisation of Russia’s forces on the German border. Nicholas decides to command the troops himself in 1915 and leaves for the front, taking over from his much more experienced cousin, Grand Duke Nicholas. This leaves Alexandra in charge at home. Under Rasputin's influence and her own conservative inclinations, she makes unwise decisions. Very few people have been told about Alexei's illness or how Rasputin appears to be helping him, so it looks like the Tsarina is losing her mind, or perhaps having an affair with Rasputin. Out on the front lines, Nicholas is visited by his mother the Dowager Empress Maria Foeodorovna , , who scolds him about not attending to crumbling domestic issues and implores him to eliminate Rasputin . On a sort of drunken whim, two decadent young princes, Grand Duke Dmitri  and Prince Felix Yusupov ([[Martin Potter , invite Rasputin to an opium party and kill him in December, 1916. Deprived of her only trusted advisor, Alexandra becomes unable to cope. Workers go on strike everywhere. The army is ill supplied. Starving and freezing, they revolt and St. Petersburg is overrun with them. Nicholas makes a long return to Tsarskoye Selo, but is forced to abdicate in his train at Mogilev, not only for himself but for Alexei, who is furious when he hears this, and becomes withdrawn, believing that the family will soon perish.  The family (and Dr. Botkin  are forced to leave the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo by Kerensky and are brought to Siberia in mid-1917, where they live under less grand conditions with rough but decent guards. In late 1917, Russia falls into the hands of the Bolshevik Party, the one revolutionary group that nobody took seriously. The Russian Civil War starts very soon afterwards, and the family is transferred to the grim Ipatiev House in Yekaterinburg, under harsher conditions, and into the keeping of the cold-blooded and unfeeling Yakov Yurovsky ([[Alan Webb  . At one point, some of the guards are physically harsh with young Alexei, so Nagorny leaps to his defence and attacks them. Nagorny is taken away and shot, leaving Alexei even more embittered and withdrawn than he was before. In a near-final tragic scene, the family is shown laughing as they read previously withheld letters from friends, relatives and teachers. Only Alexei remains aloof, sensing what is about to happen. The Bolsheviks are frantically deciding what to do as the White Army is on the verge on capturing Yekaterinburg. In the middle of the night of 16/17 July 1918, the Bolsheviks awaken the Romanov family and Dr. Botkin. Told they’re being sent to another city, the family and the doctor pack their things and wait in the cellar. Their keeper Yurovsky and his assistants enter the room, as Alexei kisses his father for the last time. They point their guns at the family, causing Olga  and Tatiana  to scream, Maria  to run into the doctor’s arms and Alexandra to cross herself. Then they open fire, and the first bullet goes through Nicholas' hand. The end scene shows the wall covered in blood."", 'The movie starts at a family dinner where Saša , a discontent Belgrade Law School student who is still living with her parents, informs them about her decision to follow her boyfriend Stefan  to Canada since he had already accepted a job offer to coach water polo there. The parents who thought the young couple were about to announce their intention to get married can hardly hide their shock and disappointment at the unexpected turn of events. Saša\'s father Miloš , a conservative judge, is particularly not happy with the fact that she\'s leaving her studies. Saša also tells them that she\'s moving in with Stefan right away, even before her visa application is processed. The young couple then leaves the dinner in a bit of a huff. While driving back to Stefan\'s apartment, they get into a car accident. Luckily both survive: Saša only with scratches and Stefan with minor head and leg injuries that require hospitalization. In the hospital Saša meets Stefan\'s sister Lana , a charming Paris-based photographer who\'s come to Belgrade in order to take care of her injured brother. While Saša gets released from the hospital the same day she wakes up, Stefan is being held for a few more weeks. While he recovers, his sister Lana seems to have forgotten the original intention of her arrival to Serbia, and spends all her time with Saša. Saša, who initially finds Lana to be very irritating, is being slowly seduced by her, and goes through the path of anger, denial, acceptance and outing in the time span of only few days. Her parents, busy with their own separation and divorce, don\'t notice their daughter\'s love life confusion right away - more precisely, they have to be told so. Both of them react very differently. Mother , who has just realized that life should not be wasted in compromises but should be lived to the fullest, is very happy that her daughter has finally found her true love. On the other hand, Saša\'s father, who tries to keep his family together at all costs, becomes very unstable and angry after hearing these news, which for him represent the last drop. While this movie supports the gay right to love and to be loved freely and openly, in the same time it condemns a homosexual and every other kind of pedophilia by showing how deep is the trauma that a sexual abuse at the young age has left on Saša\'s father. Releasing all his suppressed anger, he has Lana followed and arrested for one night on a traffic violation account, which results in Lana\'s change of spirit - from a joyful but a little superficial and inconsiderate girl she becomes a crushed pessimist, decided to escape the troublesome situation. She confronts Stefan and breaks up with Saša by telling her that ""it was a nice dream"" and that ""she wishes for her to fall in love again"", suggesting that she herself could not love again. She leaves for Paris, and things eventually work out for Stefan, who splits for Canada with a nurse from the hospital, and for Saša\'s mother too, who moves to Vienna with her new husband and her little stepdaughter. Saša\'s father dies on, so to say, the consequences of his bogus heart condition and Saša is left completely alone to stand still in a world where everybody else seems to be going places, even though in different directions. A viewer is being left with a distinct feeling of ""plots behind the plot"", i.e. there are several stories from the life of the protagonists, which are implied to but not quite revealed. Those are for example: the story about Stefan\'s and Lana\'s childhood and their relationship in general; the story about Saša\'s father\'s youth and marriage; the relationship between Saša\'s father and his assistant; and the most important - what has happened that night in prison and why has Lana decided to drop the fight so quickly. Although it may sound as a disadvantage of the scenario, it actually complements it .']"

The world-weary Count travels to New York City with his bug-eating assistant Renfield and establishes himself in a hotel, but only after a mix-up at the airport causes his coffin to be accidentally sent to be the centerpiece in a funeral at a black church in Harlem. While Dracula learns that America contains such wonders as blood banks, he also proceeds to suffer the general ego-crushing that comes from modern life in the Big Apple as he romantically pursues flaky fashion model Cindy Sondheim, whom he has admired from afar and believes to be the current reincarnation of his true love . Dracula is ineptly pursued in turn by Sondheim\'s psychiatrist and quasi-boyfriend Jeffrey Rosenberg. Jeffrey is the grandson of Dracula\'s old nemesis Fritz  van Helsing but changed his name to Rosenberg ""for professional reasons"". Rosenberg\'s numerous methods to combat Dracula - mirrors, garlic, a Star of David , and hypnosis - are easily averted by the Count. Rosenberg also tries burning Dracula\'s coffin with the vampire still inside, but is arrested by hotel security. Subsequently he tries to shoot him with three silver bullets, but Dracula remains unscathed, patiently explaining that this works only on werewolves. Rosenberg\'s increasingly erratic actions eventually cause him to be locked up as a lunatic, but as mysterious cases of blood-bank robberies and vampiric attacks begin to spread, NYPD Lieutenant Ferguson starts to believe the psychiatrist\'s claims and gets him released. In the end, as a major blackout hits the city, Dracula flees via taxi cab back to the airport with Cindy, pursued by Rosenberg and Ferguson. The coffin is accidentally sent to Jamaica instead of London and the couple miss their plane. On the runway, Cindy finally agrees to become Dracula\'s vampire bride. Rosenberg attempts to stake Dracula, but as he moves in for the kill, the two fly off as bats together. A check drops down by which Cindy pays off her  psychiatry bill to Rosenberg, to which he remarks: ""She has become a responsible person ... or whatever."" Rosenberg keeps Dracula\'s cape - the only thing his stake had hit - which Ferguson borrows, hoping  it will help him on his wedding anniversary. The last scene shows Dracula and Cindy, transformed into bats, on their way to Jamaica.', 'Renfield  is a solicitor on his way to the Castle belonging to Count Dracula  in Transylvania on a business matter. The people in the local village are fearful that vampires inhabit the castle and warn Renfield not to go there. Renfield refuses to stay at the local inn and asks the driver of the carriage that brought him to the village to take him to the Borgo Pass. The innkeeper\'s wife gives Renfield a crucifix for protection before he leaves. He is driven to the castle by Dracula\'s coach, with Dracula himself disguised as the driver. During the trip, Renfield sticks his head out the window to ask the driver to slow down, but is startled to see that the driver has disappeared, and a bat is leading the horses. Renfield enters the castle welcomed by the charming but eccentric Count, who unbeknownst to Renfield, is a true vampire. They discuss Dracula\'s intention to lease Carfax Abbey in London, where he intends to travel the next day. Dracula then leaves and hypnotizes Renfield into opening a window. He faints as a bat appears and Dracula\'s three wives suddenly appear and start to close in on him. Dracula then arrives and waves them away before he attacks Renfield himself. Aboard the schooner Vesta, bound for England, Renfield is now a raving lunatic slave to Dracula, who is hidden in a coffin and gets out for feeding on the ship\'s crew. When the ship arrives in England, Renfield is discovered to be the only living person in it; the captain is lashed on the wheel and none of the ship’s crew is discovered. Renfield is sent to Dr. Seward’s sanatorium which is adjoined with Carfax Abbey. Some nights later at a London theatre, Dracula meets Dr. Seward , who is with a group in a box seat area. Seward introduces his daughter Mina , her fiancé John Harker , and the family friend Lucy Weston . Lucy is fascinated by Count Dracula, and that night, after Lucy falls asleep in bed, Dracula enters her room as a bat and feasts on her blood. She dies in an autopsy theatre the next day after a string of transfusions, and two tiny marks on her throat are discovered. Renfield has become obsessed with eating flies and spiders and Professor Van Helsing  analyzes Renfield\'s blood and discovers his obsession. He starts talking about vampires, and that afternoon chats with Renfield, who begs Dr. Seward to send him away, because his nightly cries may disturb Mina’s dreams. When Dracula awakes and calls Renfield with wolf howling, Renfield is disturbed by Van Helsing showing him a branch of wolfbane. Van Helsing says its a plant used for protection from vampires. Dracula visits Mina, asleep in her bedroom, and bites her, leaving neck marks similar to those on Lucy. The next evening, Mina tells of a dream in which she was visited by stranger with \'red eyes and a white, livid face\'. Then, Dracula enters for a night\'s visit and Van Helsing and Harker notice that Dracula does not have a reflection in a mirror. When Van Helsing shows this ""most amazing phenomenon"" to Dracula, he reacts violently, smashes the mirror and leaves. Van Helsing deduces that Dracula is the vampire behind the recent tragedies. Meanwhile, Mina leaves her room and runs to Dracula in the garden, where he wraps his cape around her and attacks her. She is found moments later by the mouse maid and Seward, Van Helsing, and Harker retrieve her, while Dracula hides behind a tree. Newspapers report that a ""mysterious, beautiful woman in white"" has been luring children from the park with chocolate, and then biting them. Mina recognizes the beautiful lady as Lucy, who has risen as a vampire. Harker wants to take Mina to London for safety, but he is finally convinced to leave Mina with them. Van Helsing orders Nurse Briggs  to take care of Mina when she is sleeping, and not to remove the wreath of wolfbane from around her neck. Renfield escapes from his cell and listens to the three men discussing vampires. Before Martin , his attendant, arrives to take Renfield back to his cell, Renfield relates to Van Helsing, Harker and Seward how Dracula convinced Renfield to allow him to enter the sanitorium by promising him thousands of rats with blood and life in them. Dracula enters the Seward parlour and talks with Van Helsing. Dracula states that because he has fused his blood with Mina\'s, she now belongs to him. Van Helsing swears revenge by excavating Carfax Abbey and finding the coffin where he sleeps; he will then thrust a stake through his heart. Dracula tries to hypnotize Van Helsing, but without success. Van Helsing shows a crucifix to the vampire and Dracula turns away and flees the house. Harker visits Mina on a terrace, and Mina speaks of how much she loves ""nights and fogs"". Harker notices Mina’s changes, not realizing that she is slowly transforming into a vampire. A bat  flies above them and squeaks to Mina. She then tries to attack Harker but Van Helsing and Dr. Seward arrive just in time to save him. Mina confesses what Dracula has done to her, and tries to tell Harker that their love is finished. Later that night, Dracula hypnotizes Nurse Briggs into removing the wolfbane wreath from Mina\'s neck and opening the windows so he can enter. Van Helsing and Harker see Renfield, having just escaped from his cell, heading for Carfax Abbey. They see Dracula with Mina in the abbey. When Harker shouts to Mina, Dracula sees them, thinking Renfield had led them there. He strangles Renfield and tosses him down a staircase, and is hunted by Van Helsing and Harker. Dracula is forced to sleep in his coffin, as sunrise has come, and is trapped. Van Helsing prepares a wooden stake while Harker searches for Mina. Dracula moans in pain when Van Helsing impales him, and Mina returns to normal. Harker leaves with her while Van Helsing stays.', ""Matthew Van Helsing , the alleged descendant of the famed 19th century Dutch medical doctor, Abraham Van Helsing, owns an antique shop in early 21st century London. One night with Van Helsing upstairs, his secretary, Solina , allows a group of thieves, led by her boyfriend, Marcus , into the shop. The thieves infiltrate the shop's underground high-security vault and find a sealed silver coffin protected by a deadly defense system. Based on the level of security surrounding the coffin, Solina and Marcus decide that the coffin’s contents must be valuable, so they escape with it and flee to New Orleans, Louisiana. When Van Helsing discovers that the coffin has been stolen, he boards a plane to America, telling his apprentice, Simon Sheppard , to remain in London. Simon does not follow his mentor’s orders and travels to Louisiana as well. Aboard the plane, one of the thieves manages to open the coffin, revealing the dormant body of Count Dracula . Dracula awakens and attacks the thieves, causing the plane to crash in the Louisiana swamps. Dracula survives the crash and travels to New Orleans where college students Mary Heller  and Lucy Westerman ([[Vitamin C  are living. Mary is estranged from her family and has recently been plagued by dreams of a strange, terrifying man. Van Helsing and Simon arrive in New Orleans and destroy the newly turned vampires left in Dracula’s wake. After the battle, Van Helsing reveals to Simon that he is in fact the original Abraham Van Helsing who defeated Dracula in 1897. Because he was unable to destroy Dracula permanently, Van Helsing hid Dracula's body and prolonged his own life with regular injections of Dracula's blood until, one day, he could discover a way to kill Dracula for good. Simon is intrigued by Dracula's hatred of all things Christian and wonders why Dracula is also particularly vulnerable to silver. Van Helsing also tells Simon about his daughter, Mary, who was taken from England by her mother after the truth about his identity came to light. Since Mary was conceived after Van Helsing began his injections, she shares blood and a telepathic link with Dracula. Van Helsing knows that Dracula senses Mary's existence and is in New Orleans to find her. Van Helsing and Simon try to reach Mary before Dracula does, but fail to do so before Dracula turns Lucy into a vampire. Dracula and his three new brides, Solina, Lucy, and Valerie, corner Van Helsing and kill him. Simon and Mary escape, only to be captured by Dracula shortly thereafter. Dracula takes Mary to a rooftop and reveals his secret: He is none other than Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed Jesus for a bribe of thirty pieces of silver. As he went to hang himself, the rope snapped and as punishment he was cursed and had to live for two thousand years as a vampire. The three brides appear with Simon, and Dracula tells Mary to bite him. However, Mary takes the opportunity to save Simon's life by faking the bite instead. Then, together Mary and Simon kill the three brides. Angered by this, Dracula tries to throw her from the rooftop. Mary wraps some cable from a large crucifix around Dracula's neck and they both fall from the roof. Dracula hangs as he attempted to do two thousand years before, but this time the rope does not break, and he burns in the first sunlight. While Dracula dies during the fall, Mary survives the fall. In the end, she is unaware if the sun has truly killed Dracula and vows to watch over his ashes should he ever rise again.""]"

It is the Christmas holiday season. While flirting with a co-worker Sean Williams , she bumps her head on a cabinet door and is taken to the store\'s health center for a CAT scan. There she is told by company physician Dr. Gupta  she has several brain tumors resulting from a rare neurological disorder called Lampington\'s Disease. Since her HMO plan will not cover the exorbitant cost of an operation, Georgia resigns herself to the fact she has only a few weeks to live, quits her job, liquidates her assets, and sets off on a dream vacation at the deluxe Grandhotel Pupp in the spa city of Karlovy Vary in the Czech Republic. Free of inhibitions and determined to live life to the fullest, Georgia checks into the Presidential Suite, buys a designer wardrobe in expensive boutiques, makes extensive use of the hotel\'s spa facilities, attempts snowboarding and base jumping off of a dam, enjoys succulent meals prepared by world-renowned Chef Didier , and wins a small fortune playing roulette in the casino. She impresses the hotel\'s staff, with the exception of cantankerous guest services manager Miss Gunther , with her naive manner and forthright kindness, and mingles with some of the other guests, including Matthew Kragen , a self-help guru and coincidentally the owner of the store where she works; his assistant/mistress Ms. Burns ; pandering Senator Dillings  from her home state of Louisiana; and prominent Congressman Stewart . Kragen is skeptical about Georgia\'s origins and suspects her of trying to sabotage his business, but the rest are charmed by her free spirit. When Kragen bribes Miss Gunther to dig up information about Georgia\'s background, she finds a letter Georgia has written providing instructions for the disposal of her remains after her death. Miss Gunther is moved by the letter and realizes Georgia\'s self-confidence and sunny optimism have touched everyone who has met her since her arrival. She confesses to Georgia she found the letter and urges her to return home and spend her last days with those she loves. Georgia takes Miss Gunther\'s advice and heads for the airport, only to discover an avalanche has blocked the road. Unbeknownst to her, Sean - having learned of her diagnosis and ready to acknowledge his feelings for her - is in a taxi on the other side of the snowdrift, trying to reach her at the hotel. Georgia returns to the hotel, and Sean starts across the snow on foot. At a New Year\'s Eve party that evening, Kragen exposes Georgia as a saleswoman in one of his stores. Georgia tells them that Kragen is right and reveals that she\'s going to die. Kragen\'s colleagues, disgusted by Kragen\'s insensitivity, embrace her and abandon him. Dejected and embarrassed, Kragen goes up to an upper floor of the hotel and sits on the ledge contemplating suicide. Georgia tries to persuade him to come down, suggesting if he were nicer and less driven and greedy, he would be a happier person. Sean arrives at the hotel and joins Georgia and Kragen on the ledge. In the lobby, Miss Gunther finds a fax from Dr. Gupta, in which he tells Georgia she was misdiagnosed due to X-rays generated by a broken, outdated CAT scanner. Miss Gunther rushes up to the ledge to announce the good news. Georgia and Sean return to New Orleans to get married and open a restaurant, where they are visited by Chef Didier and Georgia\'s long-time inspiration, Emeril Lagasse.', ""The story is set in 1897 in and around the small peaceful  farming village of Dolwyn in Mid-Wales. A massive dam and reservoir to supply water to Liverpool has been constructed at the head of the valley above Dolwyn, but construction has stopped due to geological difficulties; what was thought to be limestone is actually granite. Realising that a cheaper and easier scheme would involve the flooding of the village, Lord Lancashire, the scheme's promoter, dispatches an agent, Rob, to visit the village and buy the land. Rob persuades a reluctant, and debt-ridden, Lady Dolwyn to sell the land, and also offers the leaseholders large sums for their leases. They are also offered new houses in a Liverpool suburb and jobs in a cotton mill for those who want them. Rob has his own reasons for wanting the village flooded; he is a native of Dolwyn, but was stoned out of it twenty years before for thievery. He is thus hated by the villagers, whom he looks down on, and especially Gareth, the village shop owner, who helped to stone him. Whilst preparing to pack up and leave, Gareth, who has also lived in England and thus is more conversant with the language, discovers documents that prove his foster-Mother, Merri , to own her hand in perpetuity. A solicitor conforms this title. Lord Lancashire himself visits Merri, but soon realises that this simple village woman cannot be bought off or cajoled - and to top it all, she is able to cure his rheumatic shoulder with simple manipulation. He decides to leave the village alone and use the more expensive and difficult method of construction. Rob is furious and decides to sabotage the dam to flood the valley. He is unable to do so and instead decides to set fire to Merri's cottage. He is confronted by Gareth and a fight ensues. Rob is knocked down by Gareth and he falls into the fire he planned to use for his devilish work. He dies of a heart attack. Merri has witnessed the events and is horrified. Determined that the killing shall not be discovered, she herself makes her way to the dam's valve room and opens the valves. The villagers watch sadly from nearby safe ground as their beloved village is slowly drowned. A short prelude to the film shows a plaque near the dam marking the deaths of two people in the flood, but that only one of the bodies was recovered. The plaque not identify the two casualties of the flood, and the mystery of their identities is used in the film to add suspense, and, more importantly, in leading to the film's theme of moral ambiguity. The riddle is implicitly answered at the film's close; of the two bodies, one belongs to the villain of the story. Clearly, this is the body that was never found, for the village was flooded in order to conceal the manslaughter forever. The one found is the body of a shepherd whose voice has been, throughout the film, the voice of the beauty of the now-flooded valley, an innocent we last see alone in the village, sitting, singing on a wall while the rising flood waters lap at his booted feet. The film may be based on the construction of the Elan Valley Reservoirs, designed to supply water to Birmingham. Some filming was carried out at these dams."", ' * Episode 1  - Young Southerner Orry Main, the only son of a wealthy South Carolina plantation owner, goes to West Point.

The seemingly helpless blonde, however, is trying to swindle her insurance company out of $25,000, as she is not handicapped in the least. While the Stooges are at work hanging posters, they are taken by one poster that advertises a great hypnotist, Svengarlic . The Stooges want the hypnotist to work his magic on Mary so that she can walk again, but Svengarlic is more interested in winning an audience by hypnotizing the Stooges. Under his spell, they walk out onto a flagpole high on a building and dance. But a distracted bicyclist knocks Svengarlic over and the Stooges are abruptly awakened. They immediately panic when they see where they are, then the flagpole breaks, sending them flying through an open window. The boys land directly in the insurance office where Mary is about to be handed her check. Startled, she jumps out of her wheelchair, exposing her scheme.', 'The Stooges are detectives who have nearly mastered the game of Gin Rummy. Their police chief B. A. Copper  has just about had it with their goofing off, and demands that they find the murderer of Slug McGurk within 24 hours. Right from the start, the trio have Chopper , a prisoner who attempts to confess to the crime. Unfortunately, his sesquipedalian confession  confuses the simple-minded Stooges, who insist he is avoiding the question. Frustrated, the Stooges throw Chopper back in a jail cell. The next man they bring up is a witness, an organ grinder with a monkey named Antonio Zucchini Salami Gorgonzola dePizza . The witness begins to download his information to the Stooges, but his Italian looks do not match the English cockney accent that comes out of his mouth. Next, Shemp takes a call regarding a dismissed bootlegging charge, stating ""The D.A. says we can\'t make a case out of 11 bottles"" . Just when all seems lost Larry returns with Chopper who says he wants to confess to the murder. However, while taking down his confession, the real killer finally shows up . Upset that Chopper is going to take the credit of the murder away from him, he pulls out a gun and starts shooting everything in site. The Stooges take cover, and are trapped in their office until dePizza\'s monkey drops several bowling balls on the killer\'s head, knocking him cold. Unfortunately, Shemp was shot several times by the killer. While Moe gives Shemp a drink to help with the pain, he tells Larry to call an ambulance for Shemp, who replies ""No, get a plumber."" and suddenly starts leaking water from the bullet holes. Moe and Larry then shrug and decide to take a shower instead.', 'The Stooges operate a local drug store whose landlord, the cantankerous Amos Flint , informs them their lease is about to expire. Larry protests that the trio have had their establishment for a decade, and do not want to leave. As the four bicker, Flint\'s elderly wife Cerina  enters the store, only to be berated by Flint for being an old hag. ""25 years is enough,"" he coldly confirms. After he storms off, the boys take to the frail Cerina, who beings to weep that ever since she lost her beauty, Amos had threatened to leave. Both saddened and incensed, the Stooges offer Cerina their spare room in the back. Shemp, seeing this, hatches a plan to invent a ""Fountain of Youth"" to restore Cerina to her stunning beauty. Deeming the idea ""tremendous, colossal and putrid,"" the Stooges flee to their pharmaceutical lab and mix a powerful serum. After several false tries, the trio give Cerina a taste of their Fountain of Youth, and she transforms into a fetching beauty right before their eyes. To celebrate her return to youth, Cerina prepares a Marshmallow Jumbo layer cake. Shemp is assigned to hunt down some of the sweet confection, but inadvertently retrieves bubblegum. The resulting celebration then finds the Stooges and Cerina blowing bubbles after every bite, with Shemp getting two bubbles out of his ears.  Several days later, Amos comes storming into the Stooges\' drug store only to see the youthful Cerina flaunting her newfound beauty. Amos quickly reneges on his threat to evict the Stooges, and requests a dose of the youthful serum himself. However, Amos overdoses on the potent stuff, and transforms into a gorilla instead. Realizing this, he starts to beat up on the Stooges. In the midst of it, Amos knocks Larry silly and starts pounding Moe’s head onto the floor. Larry comes to and breaks a bottle of Chloroform on Amos’ head, knocking him out cold. Shemp helps Moe up and, upon discovering his flattened head, tempers it back to its normal look with a hammer . Larry gets the idea to put Amos in a cage and make a mint off a traveling show involving the only talking gorilla in captivity. Moe believes that TWO talking gorillas would be even better and tries to get Shemp to take some of the concoction. Shemp knocks the spoon into Moe’s mouth, and the film ends with Moe acting like a gorilla.']"
