In the initial sequence during the opening credits, in a black screen the audience can hear different sounds of prison gates opening and someone walking down corridors, then shouts are heard and the audience is brought just outside the prison where Bruno Le Roux, a former leftist revolutionary, has just escaped. An accomplice in a mask, Jean-Jean, is waiting for him, he shoots the searchlights and both climb into a car and escape through the streets into the country. They come across a police blockade but manage to escape through a hail of bullets. The next morning Bruno lies on the grass, Jean-Jean is dead. Bruno takes everything in the car and disguises himself.  He heads to Grenoble, France, in the train but runs into the police at the train station; he manages to escape and runs into a safe-house in a garage within an apartment complex. News of his escapade reach other people involved with him in his past, amongst them Jacquillat, a drug dealer and owner of a fronting company related to transportation of goods and Jeanne and Francis, former revolutionaries. Francis wanders if Bruno shall be coming to their place but she is sure that he will try to escape to Italy. Bruno forges identifications and arranges many looks for himself, steals a car, changes the licence plates and connects a radio scanner so he can hear the feedback of the police on him. The Police are tailing Jeanne. That night Bruno pays a visit to Freddy, who obviously shares some past with him, Le Roux demands to see Jacquillat and Freddy reluctantly agrees to call him after offering help to take Bruno to Italy, which he will not do until some old scores have been settled with Jacquillat. Freddy goes to the back of the shop, Bruno sees from the window a group of policemen and also has a glimpse at Police Inspector Pascal Manise, whom he had seen earlier in the train station, and assumes that Freddy has betrayed him, he leaves the bar and sees Manise enter. He calls Freddy to tell him that it was not a smart move. Jacquillat has made his office his refuge and sends his henchmen after Le Roux. Freddy fears for his life and has become paranoid as he runs the streets he sees Bruno everywhere but when he arrives at his apartment he seems more relaxed only to be shot at the entrance of his building by Le Roux. Bruno shows up at Jeanne\'s, it turns out that she was actually expecting him and gives him a bunch of keys that she has been keeping and burns communist pamphlets that she had hidden away in her son\'s closet for 15 years. While the Police investigate Freddy\'s murder, Bruno gets a glimpse at Jacquillat but does not engage him, because he is talking to Manise. Bruno pays a visit to Madame Guiot, the mother of Jean-Jean and tells her that he is dead and that now he will take care of her, she refuses and throws him out. Le Roux goes to an apartment with the new keys but he tries to open the wrong door and a neighbour emerges from the apartment, he apologizes for the mistake and goes to his apartment, but now there is a witness about his looks and knows that he must change his plans. He takes a lot of explosive materials from the apartment and guns and burns the apartment. He bombs the Court House. This triggers the police to arrest Jeanne for questioning but she is still loyal to him and will not say a word. In the meantime, Le Roux has been following Jacquillat\'s henchmen and ends up following Banane, a petty drug dealer, who while selling drugs on the street ends up beating a woman, at first Le Roux does not intervene but the beating is so strong that he cannot take it anymore and engages Banane with his gun and forces him to open the letterbox where he hides his drugs, she takes all she can and leaves. Bruno frisks Banane and finds a photo of the woman who has just left; Banane has been ordered not to sell her anything. Bruno poses then as ""Yvan"" says that he wants to meet Jacquillat. Just as he is about to leave, the woman comes back with news that the police is all around the place. They must wait it out but she is very sick from withdrawal syndrome, she offers to take him to her place where he will be safe after she figures out that the police is looking for him, her husband is Manise and no one shall look for him there. Once at the apartment she shoots up and falls asleep. Just as he is about to leave, Agnès  keels over and is about to die due to overdose, Bruno hesitates but finally saves her. While he is washing her wounds in the bathroom she tells him that in 15 years of marriage, her husband has always provided her with all the drugs she wanted but now he has stopped and it is the first time that she has had to buy her own fixes. He promises her to help her get more drugs. He tells her that his name is Pierre. Jeanne is liberated. Early in the morning Bruno goes to Banane\'s and learns that a meeting with Jacquillat has been set at 23:00. Later that same morning, while Jeanne is preparing a little celebration for her liberation, Bruno asks her to help him that night, she refuses to help him and the only thing that she will do for him is cross him over the border into Italy. He refuses and reminds her that she has been free and able to live her life only because he and all the others who have spent time in prison have kept their mouths shut, therefore she owes them, he will come at 22:45 for her. Agnès takes ""Pierre"" to a chalet in the mountains and promises him to get a car. In the chalet, while preparing for that evening, Bruno is confronted by Cécile the owner of the chalet, because Cécile thinks that her husband is having an affair with Agnès. They tell her that he is Pierre an unemployed machinist and Agnès\' lover, after Cécile is more calm she offers to get him a job and leaves. Bruno goes to Jeanne\'s but she is not there. He goes alone to the meeting which turns out to be an ambush, there is shoot out, many are killed. Bruno manages to escape and calls for Jeanne to help him. She takes him to the chalet, where they discuss about Bruno\'s outdated ideas and demands to know that if he can justify the deaths of several innocent people that they have killed during their terrorist attacks. Jeanne confesses to Francis what she did , but when asked about Le Roux\'s whereabouts, she still will not say anything.  The next day at the chalet Bruno is confronted again by Cécile, who now believes that he is Agnès\' dealer and the one who is blackmailing Manise but he denies it and tells her that Manise actually is a wife beater, she leaves. Bruno knows he has to leave and steals a car that happened to be near the chalet. Once in the city he is cut off by many police blockades, he dumps the car and goes to Jeanne\'s, but she is not there. When she arrives, Bruno beats Francis to force her to help him. She unwittingly reveals that the police will not search her car because they are not looking for a woman with a child. Bruno has Jeanne tie Francis up and they leave her apartment with the child. They pass the blockade and he then manages to arrive at his safe house in the garage, but does not know that Jeanne has followed him. She then goes to Manise\'s place and tells him where to find Le Roux. Manise discloses Le Roux\'s location to both the police and Jacquillat. Le Roux hears movements outside his hide out and manages to escape, the police and Jacquillat\'s henchmen have engaged in a shoot out which gives him the opportunity to leave undetected. He goes to Jacquillat\'s office where he shoots him and takes his car with which he goes to the chalet. He starts climbing the Alps in order to escape to Italy but on the top of a mountain he walks into a crevasse, he tries to climb out but he cannot and sinks to the bottom.', '{{plot|dateIntroStory Mladen is a young professional residing in Belgrade where he works as construction engineer in a decrepit state-owned company that\'s undergoing the process of privatization. He drives a beat-up Renault 4 and rents an apartment with his wife Marija  who teaches English in a primary school. Together they\'re raising their only child—an 8-year-old boy named Nemanja . Despite their limited means, they\'re still managing to make ends meet and provide for their son. They arrange and lead a fairly normal and happy family life—cheering Nemanja on at swim meets and taking him to the local playground where Mladen becomes acquainted with their blonde neighbour  who also brings her daughter to play there. However, everything drastically changes one day when Nemanja is rushed to the hospital following a collapse at gym class in school. After undergoing emergency reanimation, he is diagnosed with a heart muscle condition that requires immediate surgery since the next inflammation that could come at any time might be fatal. They are further informed by Dr. Lukić , that the procedure is only performed at a clinic in Berlin, Germany, costs {{€}}26,000 and is not covered by domestic health insurance plans. Faced with this shocking development and the knowledge that they have nowhere near the money that is required for the surgery, Mladen and Marija look into different ways of coming up with the funds. Mladen applies for a bank loan, but gets flatly rejected due to not owning property and being employed at a bankrupt company. Marija submits an ad in the paper, asking for charitable donations for their son\'s surgery. When informed about it, Mladen confronts her on the issue as he is vehemently opposed to what she did. However, suspecting misplaced ego might be the source of his ire, she simply states that it\'s not beneath her pride to ask for a handout in this situation. Although they quickly make up, it is obvious that the situation is starting to put a lot of strain on their marriage. Soon, the family gets a call from a man who claims to be interested in helping Nemanja after seeing the ad, but is not willing to discuss the details over the phone so the meeting with Mladen is arranged the next day at a bar in Belgrade\'s Hotel Moskva. At the meeting, the dapper, a well-spoken middle-aged man  says he\'s willing to pay €30,000, explaining that that should cover Nemanja\'s surgery and three plane tickets to Germany. Furthermore, he says that all he wants in return is for Mladen to murder someone, seeing him as the perfect candidate to carry out the crime, because he does not have any prior record and because he is an honest, hard-working man whom no one will suspect. Counting on Mladen\'s dismayed initial reaction, the man tells him to think it over and says he\'ll contact him in two days. Coming back home, Marija is eager to hear how the meeting went, however Mladen doesn\'t mention the shocking offer he received, simply dismissing the man he met with as ""some nutcase"". Although very much tempted, at this stage Mladen hopes that he never gets a call from him again, and in search of money even looks up an old colleague from his university days . The friend quickly rejects Mladen, telling him he\'s doesn\'t have the money right now. Two days later, as he announced, the mysterious man calls from a moving car, inquiring about the decision. A torn Mladen tells him unconvincingly that it\'s a no-go. Sensing doubts in Mladen\'s voice, the man tells him to give it more thought and informs him that everything needed to carry out the murder will be in a plastic bag placed in an electrical closet underneath Branko\'s Bridge, and tells him to pick it up at 7am the next morning. Lying in bed that night, tormented, Mladen attempts to get some input and advice from Marija by saying he\'s got something important to tell her while looking ready to finally clue her in on what\'s going on. However, following his long-winded introduction, she decisively interrupts him, thinking he\'s about to go into a whiny tale of what\'s bothering him in general. She further tells him to concentrate on Nemanja rather than on himself. That morning, Mladen shows up at the bridge and finds the plastic bag containing a loaded hand-gun, a letter with instructions and a message that promises a cash advance will be in his building mail box the next day. The letter also gives Mladen a contact name Miloš Ilić along with a PO box number. While Mladen is reading the letter in his Renault, a white BMW is seen leaving the scene. A day later, Mladen takes Nemanja to school who\'s bothered by the fact that all the kids in his class saw the ad. On the way back Mladen finds €3,000 cash in his mail slot along with the intended victim\'s photo ID and address. The target is Petar Ivković, the owner of Mopex Trading Company. Using the instructions he\'s been provided about Ivković\'s habits, Mladen scopes out his apartment and watches him enter his Toyota Land Cruiser 100 series SUV to go to work in the morning. Along with a well dressed man, Mladen also spots a blonde woman and a little girl running to embrace Ivković - obviously his wife and daughter. Upon having a closer look, Mladen realizes that it is the blonde woman from the playground. While the little girl is the one that Nemanja plays and goes to school with. Deeply conflicted, Mladen goes to work where he takes out his frustration on the office equipment. Soon, Nemanja has another heart episode and is rushed to the hospital once again, but this time the doctor wants him to stay for observation, repeating that the surgery needs to be done as soon as possible. The new development puts even more strain on Mladen and Marija, as they ponder their future course of action while taking turns being with Nemanja at the hospital during the day. Both realize that something needs to be done fast. Mladen is mulling over the preparations for the murder, none of which can be discussed with her, while Marija is growing impatient with what looks to her like his lack of action and answers. Finally, late one night while Marija is at the hospital watching over Nemanja, Mladen drinks a glass of water, prepares the hand- gun, and goes out into the night. At the same time while he is waiting in front of Ivković\'s apartment, Nemanja gets another attack and a horrified Marija calls the nurse for help. Meanwhile, Ivković\'s SUV pulls up, he exits, Mladen approaches and following a short verbal exchange fires a succession of bullets at Ivković, killing him instantly. Simultaneously, Nemanja is fighting for his life as his pulse drops, but the doctors somehow manage to stabilize his condition. After the murder, a distraught Mladen is back home where he hides the gun and compulsively washes his clothes clean of powder residue. Emotionally drained, Marija also arrives home and gets very angry to see Mladen after the rough night she endured. Perplexed and completely disconnected from each other, they\'re barely on speaking terms. She finally implores him to say and do something in order to start dealing with this situation, but distracted and overwrought with guilt over what he did, he just tells her to move away from him. From that night they start sleeping in separate beds. During Petar\'s funeral, Mladen watches the procession from a distance and sees the man who hired him giving condolences to Petar\'s widow Jelena. Petar\'s brother  gives an emotional and impassioned speech vowing to find the killers and get revenge. Mladen next wants to collect the rest of the money agreed upon after the murder, but has troubles reaching the man that had promised it to him. He also sends a letter to the contact PO box, but finds out that it doesn\'t even exist. Mladen realizes he was used by the man, about whom he only knows one thing: that he knew the late Ivković. To that end, Mladen starts following Ivković\'s widow, hoping to get some leads. However, he only finds her collapsing on a park bench while taking her daughter out to play. Mladen takes her to the hospital, and, after coming to, she tells him that she took a little more sedatives than usual and that she didn\'t want to kill herself despite the fact that even the doctors don\'t believe her. She finds comfort in talking to someone who is not from her late husband\'s ""business"" milieu. She tells him she is aware that she\'s receiving phony condolences from many of her late husband\'s friends and is convinced the murderer came from there. She also lets on that she knows her husband to have been involved in all kinds of dodgy stuff by saying that all of them knew his one side, but adds that he was the love of her life and was wonderful to her and her two daughters. Deeply conflicted and torn, Mladen is visibly troubled with the fact that he\'s listening and comforting the woman whose husband he just killed. While she\'s thanking him for all he\'s done for her, his conscience can\'t take it anymore and he excuses himself and quickly leaves. Mladen\'s descent continues. Tormented by guilt and crushed by the fact he can\'t collect the rest of the money, he stumbles around the city drunk and gets into a fight with some arrogant youngsters, smashing the windshield of their Mercedes with a large rock. After getting beaten, he is taken to a police-station where he spends the night in custody. The next day, when questioned about the incident with the youngsters, he suddenly admits to killing Petar Ivković and tells the inspector  every single detail of how it went down. The Inspector, however, claims to not believe a word of it and sends Mladen home while admonishing him for ""wasting valuable police time on nonsense"". Mladen comes home where Marija has had just about enough of his mysterious and days-long disappearances, which she sees as his failure to deal with the situation properly and even abandonment of his family. She confronts him verbally for withdrawing inwards, calling him a ""good-for-nothing weakling"". In the middle of her rant, he can\'t take it any longer and slaps her across the face. Later, Mladen gets a call from the man who hired him, who threatens that he will kill him and Nemanja if he keeps talking about his deed. After hearing a gypsy speaking on the other end of the phone, Mladen realizes where his antagonist is and rushes into his car and starts following the man\'s silver BMW. After following the man to his home, a massive compound on the outskirts of Belgrade, Mladen realizes what needs to be done. He returns to his small apartment and takes his hand-gun, loads it and heads to the compound. Mladen creeps inside and deliberately activates the BMW\'s security system. When the man comes outside to see why it is chirping, Mladen appears, pointing a pistol at him and asking for his money. The man confesses that he is indebted to over {{€}}500,000 and begs of Mladen to kill him, claiming that he would rather get shot in the forehead than chopped to pieces by the thugs that he is indebted to. Mladen leaves him and sits by the swimming-pool, where he gets a call from his wife, who says that somebody put {{€}} 30,000 in their bank account. Afterwards, Mladen goes to Petar\'s wife and tells her that he killed her husband . He offers her the opportunity to kill him with the same gun he used to kill Petar. She declines and instructs him to leave, which Mladen does, leaving the gun behind on the table. As he leaves he sees Petar\'s brother approach the home with Petar\'s daughter, who waves to Mladen. Mladen waves back and gets in his car and stops at a red light, remaining still even once the light turns green . Eventually a black SUV pulls up and shoots Mladen in his car . Whether Mladen is dead or just injured is left ambiguous as the film ends.', 'The film\'s narrative structure is a largely non-linear series of key events from the life of Édith Piaf, many of which the audience ultimately learns are evoked as flashbacks from within Édith\'s own memory as she dies. Despite the fractured narrative approach, the film is anchored at the beginning by predominance of elements from her childhood, and at the end with the events prior to and surrounding her death, poignantly juxtaposed by a performance of her song, ""Non, je ne regrette rien"" . The film opens with Édith as a small child in 1918, crying on a stoop after being teased by other children on the streets of Paris. Her mother stands across the alley singing, busking for change. Édith\'s mother writes to her child\'s father, the acrobat, who is fighting in the trenches of World War I battlefields, informing him that she is leaving Édith with her mother so she can pursue the life of the artist. Her father returns to Paris and scoops up a sick Édith, then in turn leaves the child with his own mother, who is a madam of a bordello in Normandy. Now living as a child in a brothel, surrounded by the often brutal and demeaning business of prostitution, Édith is taken under the wing of the women there, especially Titine , a young troubled redhead who becomes emotionally attached to the little girl. Titine sings to, plays with, and tenderly cares for Édith through travails including an episode of keratitis-induced blindness that is healed through their prayers to St. Thérèse. Years later, Édith\'s father returns for her. Despite anguished protests from both Titine and Édith, he takes the child away to join him as he works as a circus acrobat. As Édith is outside cleaning up after dinner one night, she watches a fire eater practicing, and in the flames sees an apparition of St Thérèse, who assures her that she will always be with her—a belief that she carries with her for the rest of her life. When Édith is nine years old, her father leaves the circus after an argument with the manager and begins performing on the streets of Paris. During a lackluster performance of her father\'s contortionist skills while Édith holds a hat for coins, a passerby asks if Édith is part of the show and, with prompting by her father to ""do something"" so the half-interested audience doesn\'t leave, she spontaneously sings ""La Marseillaise"" with raw emotion, mesmerizing the street crowd. Years later, a nightclub owner named Louis Leplée  approaches Édith while she sings  on the streets of Montmartre for supper money with her friend Mômone. He invites her to his club for an informal audition. Impressed, he hires her, after creating for diminutive Édith a stage surname of Piaf, a colloquialism for sparrow. Soon, Leplée is shot dead, suspected by the police to be due to Édith\'s connections to the mafia through the pimp who has demanded a large portion of her street singing earnings. When Édith next attempts a show at a low grade cabaret, she is jeered and shouted off the stage by a hostile crowd, but she soon meets her next mentor—Raymond Asso, a songwriter and accompanist. He enlivens her performances by teaching her to gesture with her ""great hands"" while singing, and works with her on enunciation and other aspects of stage presence, including how to battle her initial fierce bouts of stage fright that almost prevent her from taking the stage for her first music hall performance. While performing in New York City, Édith meets Marcel Cerdan , a fellow French national who is a boxer competing for the World Champion title. Though she quickly learns from him that he has a wife, who runs their pig farm while he\'s away, Édith tells Mômone that she is falling in love with Marcel. The affair that ensues, while supposedly secret, results in the playing of ""La Vie En Rose"" being played for Marcel wherever he goes. The morning after Édith has persuaded Marcel to fly to her from Paris to join her in New York, she wakes up to his kiss. She joyfully hurries to get him coffee and her gift to him of a watch, while she mocks and exasperatedly shouts at her oddly subdued entourage as they listlessly stand around her apartment. They finally break the news to her that Marcel\'s plane crashed. Édith hysterically searches for the ghost of Marcel that was lounging on her bed just a few moments before, crying out the name of her lost lover. The narrative bookends these scenes from Édith\'s middle life with repeated vignettes of an aged-looking Édith with frizzy red hair, being nursed and tended to. She spends much of her time sitting in a chair by the lakeside, and when she stands, she has the stooped posture and slowness of a much older person. Another set of fractured memories shows Édith with short curly hair, plastered to her face like she is feverish, singing on stage and collapsing while she tries to sing, a moment when Édith herself realizes that her body is betraying her, when she is hosting a party at a Parisian bistro, and topples a bottle of champagne because of her developing arthritis, and to the morphine addiction that ultimately plays a large role in her demise, as she injects the drug with a young lover in her bedroom. After her husband persuades her to enter rehabilitation for her addiction, she travels to California with him, Jacques Pills, and the audience sees the sober but manic-by-nature Édith being driven around in a convertible, laughing, joking, teasing her compatriots and generally being the life of the party, until she takes the wheel and promptly drives into a joshua tree. The hilarity is uninterrupted as Édith gets out and pretends to hitchhike—the whole episode appearing to be a metaphor for her lifelong frantic efforts to be happy and distracted by entertaining others, through all manner of disasters. Years later, Piaf, now frail and hunched, squabbles with her entourage about whether or not she will be able to perform at the Olympia. No one but Édith thinks that she will be ready to attempt the feat, but she ultimately faces this reality herself. Then, a new songwriter and arranger shows up with a song, ""Je ne regrette rien"", and Édith exclaims: ""You\'re marvelous! Exactly what I\'ve been waiting for. It\'s incredible. It\'s me! That\'s my life, it\'s me."" She announces that she will indeed perform it at the Olympia. Memories from prior to and during her last performance, when she collapses onstage, are interwoven through the film, foreshadowing the tragic end to a stellar but prematurely ended stage life. The memories appear to almost haunt Piaf. In one series, prior to what turns out to be her last performance, Édith is finally ready to go onstage after a series of delays, when she asks for the cross necklace that she always wears. As her staff rush away to get it, she sits and, in her quiet solitude, experiences more memories of her past, and after Édith puts on the retrieved cross and shuffles out onto the stage, the film presents more flashbacks as she is singing one of her signature songs, ""Je ne regrette rien."" She relives a sunny day on a beach with her knitting, when an older Édith with an obvious stoop graciously answers the simple and polite questions of an interviewer: what is her favorite color? , her favorite food? , and then more poignant questions that she also answers without hesitation, again showing the longings of her life. If you were to give advice to a woman, what would it be? ""Love."" To a young girl? ""Love."" To a child? ""Love."" As though he is carrying a swaddled infant, Louis easily carries Édith, tiny and wasted away at the age of 47, into her bedroom and tucks her into bed, while the subtitle removes any illusions that this is other than the last day of her life. She is afraid. She says she cannot remember things, but has a disjointed series of memories of the kind of small moments that somehow define all our lives more than the ""big moments"" do—scrambled and fragmentary as a dying person might experience—her mother commenting on her ""wild eyes,"" her father giving her a gift of a doll, and thoughts of her own dead child, Marcelle. The film ends not with a death scene, which is implied, but with Édith performing ""Non, je ne regrette rien"" at the Olympia.']"

She finds it beautiful and decides to keep it. The same night in her hotel room, when all her friends have gone for dinner, Bhama takes it out and keeps on her bed. The sculpture magically turns into a young man , who passionately kisses Bhama. Bhama is attracted to him, but he vanishes. At her study leave, while preparing for examinations, Bhama again feels his presence. She moves towards a tree, but is stunned to find a beautiful blue butterfly. She hears his voice in the air, introducing himself as a gandharva who has developed a particular liking for her. At her request, he appears in front of her as a normal man. The gandharva asks her to call him Devan and she falls in love with him. Bhama asks her grandmother  about gandharvas. Gandharvas, according to Hindu mythology, are celestial musicians and Soma providers in Devaloka, and are destined to entertain devas and lords. They are born from the sweat  of Lord Brahma and have no death, with the ability to change form or appear anywhere at will. When gandharvas commit crimes, they are cursed to roam the earth for several kalpas, inhabiting Paala trees, seducing mortal women and stealing their virginity before abandoning them. Bhama asks Devan if he would ever desert her, to which he replies that he is just a slave of Lord Indra and has no power to remember the past once they left the earth. But Devan assures her that he will stay back on earth and will never return to Devaloka. Devan hands her a diamond named Rudhiraksham, which is holy and divine. He adds that whenever she feels like seeing him, she just has to kiss it. Meanwhile, Pradeep , Bhama's fiancé, is desperately trying to woo her, which she flatly refuses. He finds Devan and Bhama together at restaurants and parks, which he reports to her mother ([[Sulakshana . One day, Devan makes a surprise visit to Bhama's house and stuns her. With his magical talent in music, he wins the hearts of both her mother and grandmother. Both now are willing to see her married to him. Everything seems to be going fine, when one evening, Devan loses his voice. A voice  speaks to Devan from the fallen branch of the Paala tree, whose sap starts to bring forth blood, warning him that he has broken the laws of Devaloka and that he is to be punished for his crimes by Chitraradhan, who is the king of the celestial city of the gandharvas. Devan and Bhama frantically try to run away from the situation, but in vain. As he is about to be taken away from Bhama, Devan motions to Bhama to not summon him with the holy Rudhiraksham again. A lost and gloomy Bhama pines for her beloved in the forthcoming period, which worries her family, making them agree to her marrying Devan, assuming that would make her happy. However, when her father  asks her to request Devan to bring his parents so that their marriage may be fixed, Bhama finds herself in a quandary. Left without a choice, she is forced to violate Devan's warning and summon him with the Rudhiraksham. Devan does not appear before her; instead, Bhama perceives the terrible lashes that are being meted out in punishment to the gandharvan. More than a week passes, and one night Bhama finds, to her joy, that Devan has returned to her. Devan informs Bhama that he had to undergo cruel tortures in the halls of Chitraradhan's celestial palace for seven nights and seven days. While a gandharva is not supposed to come in daylight and is not permitted to meet human beings other than his lover, Devan had broken the law by appearing in public and singing songs for others. He also violated the rule of turning the mortal woman he comes into contact with into a mere slave for taking away her virginity, and gave Bhama control over him by giving her his holy Rudhiraksha, with which she could summon him at will. After the punishments were over he was given back his voice, on condition that he should not speak to Bhama with it. A worried Bhama listens to Devan as he tells her how he needs no voice, if it were not to speak to her, and that he had to wait the past two nights to hoodwink the Spies of the Night to come and meet her. He declares that he is fed up with the bondages of Svarga , and that unlike his previous encounters with mortal women, he passionately loves Bhama, and the warmth of her family and human relationships, to the point of wanting to live and die as a human being with her. He tells Bhama that if he manages to not attract the Spies this third night, he will succeed in permanently turning into a human. Suddenly, strong winds blow at the couple. As the winds die down, a burning celestial handcuff falls onto Devan's forearm and as he painfully manages to remove it, the Divine Creator and the gandharvas' celestial father, Lord Brahma , speaks to the gandharvan, informing him that he and his crimes, which include his persistence in desiring the lowly mortality of earth, have once again been discovered. Lord Brahma also warns him that the harsh punishments of Indra, lord of the devas, await him in Naraka , including having to embrace and sleep with molten hot female figurines, each one representing a moment he spends with Bhama that night, among other tortures in hells filled with snakes, poisoned spears and floors slipping with blood. Lord Brahma informs his son that he is now forbidden from all sunlit days and moonlit nights for all time to come and that the holy Rudhiraksham which he had given Bhama will turn into powerless white dust, which Bhama immediately confirms to be true, to her utter horror. The only way for him to alleviate some of the gravity of his punishment is to take Bhama's virginity from her before the Seventeenth Wind of the Night comes to take him to hell, thus erasing both their mutual memories forever, and failing which, Brahma tells Devan, he will be sentenced to turn into a hideous, foul-smelling beast, neither human nor gandharva, roaming around for a billion kalpas. Devan decides to refuse his Divine Father's advice, and prepares to welcome his terrible fate. Bhama advises him to leave her and go back, so that he will not have to undergo the severe tortures of Indra. She also wants to give up her virginity to him, for although Devan's memories are her most valued possession, she wants to sacrifice them in order to save him and to not have to bear the continued perception of his cruel tortures which would otherwise haunt her throughout her life. They indulge in a physical relationship that night, which she considers the most valuable gift that she can have from him. The night fades away and the heavy Seventeenth Wind of the Night comes in. When the wind moves away, Devan slowly vanishes and Bhama is shown weeping and looking far away."", ""The film opens with a person  who goes to a guru in Manchester, who tells him that he has to pay for his crimes in this life and the next one too. That person then goes to the cellar of a Mansion called Dia Mansion, writes all that he has done on a letter, places it in a huge coffin-like box, and then shoots himself. The next part of the film opens in modern day UK, where the protagonist Dr. Kabir Malhotra  is shown living happily with his wife Sia . One day she goes missing without even a word. The worried doctor searches for her everywhere and questions everyone including her best friend Monica  but does not find anything, until he comes across Disha, a musician and sooth sayer with special powers of premonition on touching objects who does that job for free. Initially Kabir insults her and rejects her, but later on being convinced by inspector Asif Sheikh about her authentic powers, he agrees to take her help. With Sia gone, Kabir reflects on everything in the past- how he found Sia, how he had fought with other men at bars who went near her, how they had a good time. Soon Disha and the police find that Sia had gone with Monica and somebody else in a car somewhere, and that car is found abandoned. Kabir and Disha go to Monica's house, only to find that she has been murdered. The case takes an interesting turn when Disha happens to visualize something about Sia, whch she does not tell Kabir because of her fear that it would be too shocking for him to accept. Soon Kabir and his parents get a call that Sia has been kidnapped, and the kidnapper asks for 1 million pounds from Kabir's parents. The kidnappers ask Kabir to come alone to deliver the money through directions given to him time and again over phone. Kabir goes with transmitters fitted on him and the police tracking him, but these measures are rendered useless by the apparently smart criminals. Soon Kabir finds himself in a dance bar, where the bags are taken from him, but the criminals find that it is filled with only paper, and they beat him and threaten to kill his wife. Kabir chases them, only to be stopped by Disha who arrives at the scene. She tells him that she knows where his wife is. Disha takes Kabir and the cops to Dia Mansion, where on searching they come across the cellar and the coffin box. Kabir opens it to find a skeleton and a worn out parchment. He reads all that was on it, and understand that this was written by none other than himself centuries ago. Kabir had at that time been deceived by a jealous friend of his into believing that his wife was unfaithful, and he murdered his wife and kept her in the coffin box. Later on knowing the truth, he was not able to forgive himself, so he had approached a guru, who told him that he will pay for his crimes now and in the next life, and told him what to do next. Kabir had then written everything and had shot himself at the cellar. Soon the kidnappers send a disc to Kabir's family with a video of Sia being tortured as a warning not to call police, and this time Kabir is called to an isolated ship to pay up and take his wife. On reaching the ship, Kabir goes alone, but Disha sees a gang of goons following him, senses danger and follows him secretly. On the deck, Kabir meets with the greatest shock of his life when he sees his wife, hale and hearty waiting to meet him, with none other that her Englishman boyfriend, whom Kabir had once beaten in a bar for going to Sia. Apparently everything that has taken place has been an act and both have been involved in the entire drama. Sia shoots Kabir in the shoulder. She then tells him that she and the Englishman were lovers, and that her only interest in Kabir was in his father's money an property, for which she married him. She also admits that it was she who killed Monica as the latter was involved in the crime and knew all about it. They tell Kabir that on killing him, she will put up an act of innocence before his parents and later the property will be transferred to her.They also say they shall eliminate his parents. As Kabir is going to be shot again, Disha breaks in and pushes the gun off Sia's hands. Kabir breaks fee and beats up all the goons. Disha is pushed off the ship and hangs on the deck margins. Kabir goes to save her, manages to pull her up, but gets stabbed by Sia's lover. Everyone flees the scene. Sia arrives at Kabir's house and tries to convince his parents that he was killed by goons, but there comes Inspector Asif, who has come to know about everything, telling them the truth. He arrests Sia on charges of attempting to Murder Kabir and on charges of murdering Monica. Now in hospital, in a critical condition and under surgery, Kabir's souls leaves his body and meets Guru, who tells him that he has faced the punishment for his crimes in the past, but he has also saved lives as a doctor, so the circle of karma is complete, and that he shall live. The film ends in Goa, India, where Kabir arrives as a surprise guest at the house of Disha who has moved down to India. He says that he searched and found a picture of the past of him and his wife. His wife of the past happens to be none other than Disha herself. Disha says she knew this but was afraid to admit it as she feared falling in love again."", ""Ravi  is a well educated guy but hasn’t got a job yet. Unlike others, he doesn’t find any job big or small…he just takes up anything that comes his way. The movie opens showing him delivering Newspapers at people’s doors – but the job is not permanent. He likes painting and usually makes paintings that depict village life…on being asked by his friend he says city life is very mechanical and he doesn’t like it. When his Maa ji  sees one of his paintings she says that the house in his painting is so much like his dadaji’s house. But alas, his father had to leave it and come to the city because of sarkari naukari. Saying that she leaves for post office to collect her husband’s pension but he stops her. He goes to the Post Office instead. At the Post Office, Om Shivpuri is interviewing people for the post of a Post Man at Sitapur and gets so frustrated talking to people who come for the interview. When Ravi comes to collect his father’s pension, he takes it for granted that he’s one of the interview candidates and starts asking him questions. He asks Ravi for his age and Ravi says : As per certificates, it’s 21 but that’s not correct. Om: How can you say that? Ravi : Because no one knows which year I was born in…Mom says there was a flood in the village the year I was born, as though I wouldn’t have been born had it not been for the floods. She also says, I was born after 2 years since she got married and there was a drought that year. This part is very interesting. Ravi, unaware that he’s being interviewed answers with such carefree attitude. And Om Shivpuri, on the other hand is also pleasantly surprised and enjoys the conversation. At the end of 5 minutes, Om Shivpuri offers him the job and Ravi gladly takes it up. Now that he’s an official postman, he comes home in Postman’s uniform and says : Postman….money order. His mom comes to the door, checks the sheet: Maa : Yeh kaisa moneyorder hai bhai?  Ravi : Bhai nahin maa, beta kaho beta!  Maa tu toh aise ghabra gayi…daakiya bana, koi daaku thodi na bana…aur phir sarkari naukari hai – rehne ke liye kapda makaan muft aur rotiyaan Manoj Kumar se maang lenge.  Maa : Woh kaun hai?  Ravi : Maa tu picturen nahin dekhti. His mother is worried that he’s going for such a job when he’s so well educated. But he is happy to be employed. So he sets out for Sitapur. After getting down from the train, he boards Nattu’s  Tanga bound for Sitapur. Existing Post Master explains his job to him…says his job would also include writing letters for others, reading out their letters etc. apart from just delivering them…because not everybody in the village is literate. Ravi is asked to share his quarters with Raghu Rampuri, who’s a unique-piece item. The moment Ravi enters the house Raghu says : The only two things that are famous from Rampur are – me and chaku.And then introduces him as a poet. When Ravi says that he’s never heard his poems, Raghu says : it’s just that I am ahead of my poems – I became more famous than my poems. Parcel  lives with Raghu. He cleans the house and cooks for him, in return Raghu teaches him how to read and write. Ravi : Kiska ladka hai?  Raghu : Daak khaane ka . He lives at the post office, noone knows who his parents are but he loves reading. Maybe he’ll also become a Postman like you when he grows up.On his first day at work, he goes to the temple in the morning to deliver Panditji’s letter and sees Mohini  there. There’s an old lady in the village, whose son, Rasulla, had joined the Army and gone away… and who never returned back. She’s gone insane waiting to hear from him. She sits guarding a mango tree from other kids in the village. She’s been dying to hear from her son for years and when Ravi comes there and chases the little boys troubling her away, she sees the letters on the carrier of Ravi’s cycle and takes them away saying all those are her son’s letters. He has to coax her into giving those letters back to him. And then he pulls out a blank paper from the stack of letters and recites : Meri pyaari ammi….pretending to read the content from a letter. And at the end he asks her : Nani, what’s your son’s name? And after she says the name, he ends the letter saying : Tera beta Rasulla.Then he goes about delivering letters…he goes to a house and knocks, Mohini opens the door and is delighted to see the Postman…he hands over a letter - Ravi : I am new here, had I known this letter was for you, I would have given it at the temple itself. Mohini : You are new, that’s why I didn’t ask you if there was any letter for me when I saw you in the temple. But the letter is not for her, somebody showed him the wrong house and she’s very disappointed. She, however, guides him to the correct address, Choudhary’s house. His daughter, Chhutki  opens the door and talks non-stop that her father is not home with lots of if-else conditions. Finally when she’s done, he gives her the letter and leaves. Chhutki’s wedding has been fixed and the letter is from her sasural, she’s very excited to know what’s written in it…so she comes to call Mohini so that they both could go somewhere and read the letter. She takes permission from Mohini’s maa  and they both leave with an excuse of fetching water from the well.She opens the letter, puts the envelope behind on a stone wall surrounding the well and starts reading the letter. But she can’t read properly and can’t figure out what’s written in it…she asks Mohini for help but she can’t read either. She says she would have gone and joined the army if she knew how to read and write. When they see people coming towards them, she tries to collect the envelope and leave from there, but in a hurry, she misses it and the envelope goes flying down into the well. There’s a beautiful song here – Allah megh de. The letter finally reaches the Chaudhary and he reads it but is perplexed thinking how the Daakiya could have brought the letter without an envelope, which means no address. Chhutki lies to him saying that the letter was delivered without the envelope. And as though her saying so would help she says : Good that the kept the envelope. Imagine if he had to keep the letter and just give the envelope to us. We would never get to know what’s in the letter. When Daakiya comes the following morning, Chaudhary is still perplexed wondering about the missing envelope and he asks him if he has come to distribute just the envelopes today. Now, it’s Ravi’s turn to get confused. He’s accused of taking the envelope away.  Finally Mohini comes to his rescues and spills the truth to Chaudhary. Next, he goes searching for Aarti Sharma to give Money order….when he reaches her house, he sees her busy making quilts. She stops her work to chat with him for a while and says that it’s her husband’s pension. Aazadi ke jung mein saheed hue the - She claims to be an army’s widow and yet she puts sindoor. He’s kind of confused. And finding his puzzled expression very natural, she goes on to explain that she’s Amar suhagan and all the others in the village call her Suhagi didi. She says she waits for this day not because she would get money but for her husband…she feels connected to him in some way and when she puts sindoor she feels that he’s still somewhere around. Ravi takes her hand, and takes her thumb impression on the paper before giving her the Pension amount. But she doesn’t keep the money…she sends it for the welfare of other armies who are fighting day and night, protecting the country and ensuring everybody’s safety. At the end he realizes that she’s educated and can converse fluently in English as well. He leaves feeling embarrassed for taking her thumb impression instead of asking her to sign. Ravi sits under a Peepal tree in front of Mohini’s house and sorts his letters. And she awaits a letter herself quite desperately so keeps asking him if there’s a letter for her. Ravi replies to her and continues with his work. Mohini  : Do you want some water? Ravi  : Yes, a glass of water, please. Mohini : What will a glass of water do, I will have to get a bucket full of water for you. And then she asks him if he would want some water…to this he replies - Ravi : Yes, but not in a bucket. She goes towards the house and then stops half way through to ask if buttermilk would do. He nods. And she comes with a glass of buttermilk for him. Mohini : if I get any letters, do give it to me. Ravi : Who else would I give it to? Mohini: Oh I mean, don't give it to Maa. Ravi : Once bitten twice shy, I would never make that mistake again. I have learnt a lot from Chaudhary saab’s letter episode . She behaves pretty mysterious asking about letters so he asks her if she gets letters often. Mohini : No, but just in case if I get any letters. Ravi : You wait so much for them, you must have got them earlier too. Mohini : No, not yet, but… Ravi : Who is it that you expect to hear from so much? Mohini :  I am supposed to get a letter form my Mamaji. And goes away saying she has to give buttermilk to her cow. Ravi : Buttermilk? To cow? Mohini : I mean water…don’t know what I am saying today Ravi  : You get so confused, has it ever happened that you kept your food plate in front of the cow and started eating the grass yourself? She laughs and goes away. Ravi sings Daakiya daak laaya as he goes about his work. He comes home from work very hungry and asks Parcel for food. Raghu gives him water and starts asking about Mohini. The entire village is talking about the two of them now. Ravi confides that he likes Mohini but has no idea how she feels for him. Just then Parcel comes with a sheet of paper and asks Raghu if it’s ok…Raghu after going through it approves of it and asks Parcel to post it. Ravi is confused as to what they both are up to. Raghu explains to him that nobody ever wrote him a letter in his life, so he’s making Parcel write one and post it. He would reply to it on receiving it. One day on his way back home, Ravi sees Mohini sitting on a tree branch and staring.He asks her what she’s looking at and she says she was thinking about the armies who were there few months ago for training. She would sit there and look at them for hours together. Mohini : This area used to be so full of armies some time back and now… Ravi : And now, let’s both go and do a parade. Mohini : Who will distribute your letters then? Ravi : We could ask anybody to do that…what’s the name of that liar friend of yours? Chhutki? Let her go around giving the letters and her father will go behind her with the envelopes She asks him why he didn’t come and sit under the Peepal tree today to sort his letters and mentions she was actually waiting for him the whole day. Ravi : You were waiting for me? or for your mamaji’s letter? Mohini : Had made daliya today, you come everyday so had kept some for you too. Ravi : Is it still there or did you give it to your cow? Mohini : I have kept some for you. Ravi : Ok then, I have to go to Suhagi didi’s house now, I’ll come over after that . Suhagi has made some quilts and blankets and she gives them to Ravi to send them across to some regiment. Ravi comes to Mohini’s place to have daliya. He barely sits down when Mohini’s cow breaks free and runs away with the rope entangled with Ravi’s cycle. Mohini’s cow running away with Ravi’s cycle – this becomes such a big breaking news and the hottest gossip in the village. Ravi goes behind the cow and finally brings both the cow and cycle home. But he gets hurt in the process. So Mohini tends to his wounds. She notices Suhagi’s parcel and asks Ravi about it. Him : She has sent it for the armies. Her : What if I want to send a parcel to somebody? Him : You should have his name and regiment address and it will reach him. But…why? You know any fauji? Her : No, I was just asking. Rekha makes a special appearance in this dance – Surme wale sainyaan hamaro ji. After a few days, she meets him by that tree again and takes his measurements for a sweater. He’s very happy and is now sure that she likes him too. Another day she complains that he never brings a letter for her and then he promises to bring a letter for her the following day. He goes home that night and sits awake the whole night writing a letter to her – putting down his feelings on paper. When he meets her, he gives her the letter and she’s extremely delighted. Then she shows him the sweater she has knit and asks him to try it. He’s happily trying it out when she looks at the letter and says – now that he has written to me and I have his address, I can send the sweater too. He is shocked to find out that it’s not for him. All his dreams are shattered and he’s heart is broken… She then tells him her story – She had met Ravi , an army officer when his battalion was training near her village, fallen in love with him and had also quietly married him in a temple. But he had to go almost immediately after that and she has never heard of him since. However, she’s sure he’ll return back to her some day. Now that he knows she’s already married, he decides to help her locate Ravi . Heartbroken as he is, he cannot help himself from singing a song – Ladkhadane do mujhe. He goes to the town the following morning searching for Ravi  but with no luck and finally comes back to Sitapur again. He meets Rasulla’s mother at the station, she gives him a letter and asks him to read it. It has the news of Rasullah’s death and the letter is dated ten years back. The very same day he receives a telegram saying that the Army Officer he was looking for has been killed in the war. With a heavy heart he goes to give the news to Mohini but there’s a huge crowd gathered there. Mohini tells him that Rasulla’s mother died of sorrow because somebody told her that her son is dead. Ravi feels guilty and tells her that he was the one who had read the letter out to her. At this she tells him he should have lied and hidden the truth from her. At least a lie would have saved her life. Everybody in the village knew of Rasulla’s death but nobody had dared to break the news to her because they were scared she would die of shock. Now, Ravi  cannot bring himself to tell Mohini of Ravi’s  death. And he goes back home with a heavier heart. He’s in a dilemma as to whether to tell Mohini the truth or to hide it from her. Mohini, on the other hand, now aware that the war has come to an end starts waiting all the more eagerly for Ravi  – Ghungta gira hai. What will Ravi do now? Will he ever be able to tell Mohini the truth? Will she ever come to know that he was once in love with her? Will she misunderstand his intentions? Mohini’s Maa is pressurizing her to get married…how long will she be able to postpone it? Will she be able to voice out and explain about her marriage with Ravi ? Is Ravi  really dead? Or Ravi  has something else in mind?""]"

Meanwhile, the sign language interpreter stands by, unsure whether to tell Ariana's mother or not. Also, Danny is preparing for a live concert at the cafe, where he will perform some of his own songs. Ariana's mother is soon told, and she then forbids her daughter from ever seeing Danny.

Her patient Carla , comes to Tess to tell her about her former lover who wanted to marry her but needed some time after his wife\'s death, even though they started going out when he was still married, but he left it a year and never came back, only to tell her that he was with someone else. Tess tries to comfort her after she thought Carla was going to jump of the edge of a building. The descriptions Carla gives Tess of her former lover seem some what familiar, but it is until the time she saw her after that, that Carla shows Tess her ring that was given to her by him, and a book that she always carries around written by him, Author: Paul Tomlinson, and just to clarify, his picture too. Tess eventually confronts Paul about this and he says that he knew her as a librarian, and the time Tess saw him hug her was to thank her for getting a \'hard to find\' book for him. He says he had no relationship with her at all except sending her flowers to thank her for all her help with the book, and that he was not sleeping with her. Tess, believes him and they go on a merry-go-round together. Afterwards, they walked around the funfair and had a lovely, little snog. Unfortunately, Carla was passing by and shouted at Tess for using her to steal him away from her. Tess told Carla that she wasn\'t, but Carla slapped her and drove away. Tess tried to run after her but Paul said to let her go. He gave her a hug and said ""God save them all"". The next day, Tess goes to Carla\'s apartment, Carla wouldn\'t go to the door but it was open so Tess walked in. Carla was nowhere to be seen, so Tess had a snoop around, she found a picture of Paul, a pot from his favourite Japanese restaurant, another book written by him, but more importantly, in a wooden chest, she found some love letters, she opened one, at the top it said \'dear my love\', and at the bottom, it said \'with all my love, Paul\'. Disturbed, she walked out with the letter. At night, in bed, she has a dream about making perfect love to Paul. In the morning, she has a shower and gets out when the slightly ajar bathroom door shuts, assuming someone was there. She then finds Paul\'s jumper on her chair. She jumps when she hears Carla\'s voice and is horrified when she turns around and finds that Carla is there. Carla tells her that Paul left it at her house this morning and came round to show her and taunt her. Tess shouts at her to get out or that she\'d call the police. Carla said it was a good idea because Tess was in danger. Carla told Tess that she\'s warning her to stay away from Paul because he killed his wife, and that he\'d kill again. Carla walked out. Outside Tess\'s house, Paul came and said he was worried about her. She told him that Carla dropped in on her shower this morning, she showed him that Carla\'s  sweater. He said he had no idea how she got it. He told her maybe she stole it because she said it herself that she broke into her house and that she was capable of anything. Then she showed him the love letter, she asked him if he wrote it, he said yes-to his wife, he had been trying to find them. Suddenly Tess asked him how his wife died, he said this was sick. He said it was an accident, she was hiking up in the mountains and he guessed that she tripped and fell, he guessed because he wasn\'t there because they had just had an argument and he went back to the cabin, the rangers said it looked like she slipped. She told him that Carla said he killed his wife. He said they weren\'t the perfect couple by any means, but he loved her. She apologised and said that she didn\'t know to explain her behaviour lately, she let herself get sucked into Carla\'s delusions. He forgave her. She asked why he was here and he said that she called and the school told him that Tess had left a message saying that it was urgent. Then they both realised, Carla. Her front door was already open. They started looking for her. Tess tried the kitchen and found everything broken and thrown around. The meat in her freezer had been stabbed, and there was blood on the walls. Paul told Tess to go back to his place and let the police take care of Carla. At Paul\'s place, he went for a shower and she fell asleep after a tiring day. She woke up, and wandered into another room-where she found his wedding picture, the glass had broken in half. The door closed behind her and she was locked in. She tried to get out but she couldn\'t. She realised that a chair was on fire and the smoke alarm went off. More desperate than ever, she struggled with the door and shouted Paul\'s name. Just in time, Paul came and opened the door and pulled her out. As he tried to put out the fire, she called 911. They arrested Carla. The police told Tess and Paul that they were only going to question her because for all they knew, it could have been either one of those two because the fire was set. Tess and Paul went to Paul\'s other house, it was snowing there. Later, again, they went to bed together. And as a surprise for Tess, Paul put a ring on Tess\'s finger. It was a surprise for her, as it was the same ring as Carla said he had made especially for her. This was enough to start believing that Paul was telling lies, and that it was Carla all along who spoke the truth. She told him she\'d be right back and went upstairs to change and pack, as he was looking the other way she quietly came down the stairs and left. In the car Carla showed up after she had been questioned and told her she\'d have to run, because the roads were covered with ice. Tess asked her what she was doing and Carla replied ""saving your life"". She said it was him who messed up her kitchen and started the fire. They ran off. After waiting for a while, shouting her name with no replies, and searching upstairs to find no-one except a dressing gown, he realised she had gone. Paul changed, and left as well. As Tess and Carla were running on because Carla new the route well, Paul found it easy to follow them because it was snowing and he just followed their footprints. He eventually caught up with them. Carla told him that Tess knew everything and he told Tess that he loved her. Carla told him that Tess knew that he killed his wife. He said she was crazy. She reminded him when he brought her up there that weekend and his wife found them, and when he told his wife how much he loved Carla. She said that when his wife\'s back was turned on the mountains, he snuck up and pushed her. Tess interfered and said that if Carla was lying, how would he explain the ring, that Carla has exactly the same. He said he only gave the same ring to his wife whom never took it off, and as far as he knew, she was buried with it. That is when they realised. Tess asked Carla, ""you killed her?"". She said she did it for each other. Paul angrily started walking forward. Carla was slowly walking back and didn\'t notice a huge drop behind her, she slipped, and fell, but she was holding on...to Paul\'s hand. He said that he should let her die. Tess said no, hold on. Paul did, but it was too hard, she fell again and held on to a rock. Her last words were to Paul saying ""you still love me, don\'t you?"", until her hands slipped of the rock and she fell to her death crashing into many more sharp rocks along the way. Tess cries and Paul comforts her. Outside Paul\'s second house, we have to assume the next day, Tess and Paul, are getting ready to leave, putting their luggage in the car. Paul finishes putting the rest in the boot as Tess gets into the car. Looking for a map she opens a draw in the front of the car, finding two tiny boxes thinking they were for her, she opens them two find two identical heart rings, the same as she had been given from Paul and the same as his wife had been given from him. We see her with a weird face. The film ends with the camera zooming out on Paul getting into the car.']"

Unable to find anything worth his while  he spots a refrigerator inside a house and heads for it. He sneaks onto the property only to wake a sleeping bulldog. The bulldog chases the cat up to the side of the house. The cat quickly pulls out some sleeping pills, putting the dog into a deep sleep. Once inside the cat searches for food in the kitchen, but comes up empty. His luck finally changes when he finds a can of cat food. He quickly opens the can and out of the can pops a mouse who is plopped down onto a dinner plate. The cat is about to dig in with a fork but the mouse puts a quick stop to that. He says that the cat can\'t eat him because he has already seen the cartoon they are in and that he winds up saving the cat\'s life later. The feline understands but wants some food as he is starving. The mouse points into the other room and tells him that there is a huge, fat, tasty canary in there. The cat charges out into the other room and stuffs the unseen canary into a sack heading back to the kitchen. The bird is emptied from the sack, to be revealed as a scrawny little thing. The bird tells the cat, ""Well, I\'ve been sick..."" Desperate, the cat gets a  brainstorm when he sees a bottle of Jumbo-Gro plant growth formula on the shelf. Quickly he pours some of the formula into the bird and sure enough, the canary grows rapidly in size. But before the cat can take a bite, the bird is already over 10 feet tall. The canary takes advantage of his new height and beats up on the cat. The cat turns the tables on the bird and drinks the Jumbo-Gro formula himself, doubling in size until he is much bigger than the bird. He tosses the potion out of the window only for it to land in the bulldog\'s mouth. While the now giant-sized cat chases the slightly smaller canary through the side of the house, the bulldog guzzles down the formula. After a quick run around the block, the cat and canary wind up back outside of the house, where a now gigantic bulldog appears before them. The cat runs away in fear as the bulldog tosses the bottle of plant growth food down the chimney, where it rolls out of the fireplace and straight to the mouse inside the house. The dog leaps over the house and chases the cat into the city. The mouse in the house takes a few sips of plant food, instantly ballooning to gigantic size. The dog chases the cat to the city, only for the now gargantuan mouse to show up and scare the bulldog away with a simple ""Boo!"". The mouse who is as tall as a 20 story building and just as fat, reminds the cat that he told him he would save his life. The cat thanks him as the mouse hands him the bottle back and waddles off. The cat, rubs his enormous belly realizing he still is hungry, sees the huge mouse stomping off and gets another idea. He suddenly drinks more of the formula and grows even bigger and fatter than the mouse. The cat who is by now 100 stories tall, chases the giant but smaller mouse through the city and across the country, passing the Grand Canyon, Hoover Dam and the mountains. The giant mouse hides in a railroad tunnel, losing the cat for a moment. The mouse drinks the potion when the cat isn\'t paying attention and becomes even bigger than the already huge cat. The mouse starts to beat up on the cat only for the cat to take the potion back and drink it, becoming bigger than the mouse. The mouse takes it back and drinks more to become bigger still. They continues getting bigger and bigger until they suddenly both come to a stop at the same exact size. They shake the now empty bottle of Jumbo-Gro and tell the audience at home that they have to end the cartoon, as they\'ve run out of the formula. They wave goodbye to the viewers as the camera pulls back, revealing that they have outgrown the Earth itself and are standing atop the globe.', '{{Plot}} A mouse named Jinx is trying to run a cat named Jasper is holding Jinx\'s tail so that he cannot move. Jasper almost has Jinx run into his mouth, but Jinx stops in time and runs toward his mousehole. Jasper catches him with his tail and tosses the mouse into the air; he lands on the cat\'s tail, then runs down his body until he has to keep himself from being eaten again. Jinx dashes off and Jasper waltzes behind him innocently, hops in front of the door and opens his mouth. Jinx runs in this time, but then rolls out of the cat\'s mouth on his tongue. After some chasing, Jasper runs around a back pathway and makes a new mousehole on the wall by dipping his finger in magic ink, complete with a sign that says ""HOME SWEET HOME"". Jinx stops running in order to enter his hole and an invisible block knocks him out. The cat revives the poor mouse with a dash of water. Jinx recovers and soon notices that something is next to him, feels the cat\'s head and grabs an eyelid; promptly, Jasper opens his eye and hoists him up. Jinx looks at the cat and realizes who it is, gulps, and punches Jasper in the eye; Jasper shrieks in pain and retaliates by giving chase, but shortly runs into a houseplant and breaks it. His owner, Mammy Two Shoes, a black woman, quickly arrives and chastises Jasper. Jasper tiptoes away, but is soon under Mammy\'s broom, who comments about Jasper\'s mess. As Jasper pulls the broom off his face, he sees the mess; the housemaid delivers one last threat that forms the basis for the cartoon. If Jasper breaks one more thing, Mammy will throw him out for good. Mammy pushes the cat away with her broom in punctuation. Jasper creeps away, but soon runs into a table, knocking over a vase which he must catch; although he succeeds, he soon spots the mouse laughing at him. Jasper crawls over the floor malevolently, and Jinx gets out of the candlestick as Jasper runs up onto the table to catch him. He holds out a wineglass from the table and threatens to break it, which forces the cat into retreat. Meanwhile, he hears Mammy prancing around the house with the swept-up mess. Jasper gulps, chuckles nervously and walks off. The mouse nods in delight, but soon sees Jasper running after him once again and renews the threat. This time, Jinx whacks the cat with the glass, who once again hides away in fear. Tired of this, Jinx winks at the camera, throws the glass down and whistles to alert the cat, who dashes at the glass and narrowly saves it. Another whistle, another glass, the tray holding the glasses, and the four glasses that were on it follow; Jasper is lastly hit on the head with a decorated plate of flowers. Jasper sees Jinx taunting him with one more glass in his hand; frustrated, Jasper attempts to throw the plate to the ground, but realizes this would probably break it and hits himself over the head. The cat then spots pillows of all sorts on a nearby couch and lays them out, determined to end this threat. As Jinx marches along the table, Jasper pops his head up next to him and is unmoved by Jinx\'s threat. The mouse then twists his tail at the cat as if to say ""Have it your way"", and arrogantly throws the glass to the floor. Not hearing the crash he expected, he looks down to the ground and sees that the glass fell on one of the pillows, punctuated by a smug grin from the cat. Jinx\'s tail is promptly trapped by the cat; the mouse says a quick prayer, and after some quick thought adds ""Amen"". Jasper then lets him go, only to catch and toss him with his tail again, then sits with mouth open for Jinx to fall into. Unfortunately, the mouse has landed on the china rack and drops a plate down onto Jasper instead of himself. Jasper is momentarily stunned but still catches the plate, but Jinx proceeds to knock over every plate on the rack and force the cat to lug around the stack of plates. Sweating uncontrollably, Jasper finally manages to lean the stack against the wall, but he soon spots the mouse waving at him from the top of the stack. Jasper can only watch in terror as the mouse throws the last plate down to its inevitable destruction. Mammy angrily storms down the steps, proclaiming that she will evict the cat as soon as she gets down. Jinx leaps in triumph, then runs down the stack of plates, stomps on Jasper\'s nose, rolls his eyelids, squirts his milk into the cat\'s back, and even cleans himself with Jasper\'s tail; by now, Mammy is approaching with broom in hand and Jinx gets down to business by kicking the cat in the rear, which causes him to drop all the crockery and be punished unfairly by Mammy. Jinx flees the scene and dives into his hole just before Mammy squashes him underfoot. An angry Mammy drags Jasper across the floor and throws him out of the house. The triumphant Jinx watches his opponent get thrown out, and then spots the ""Home Sweet Home"" sign used to trick him earlier. The mouse posts the sign by his own mousehole and nods in confidence that this is his own one as he marches in.', '{{Plot}} The cartoon opens on a golf course. As the camera pans across the course, we see Tom trying to hit a ball out of a giant divot, and finally hits the ball out on his 50th attempt. When Tom takes the flag out of the hole, the ball promptly drops itself in...and quickly bounces out. Tom is surprised by this, and lifts the green, rolling the ball into the hole. When the ball is thrown out again, he putts. After it is thrown out again, the cat shoves the ball into the hole and pounds the end of his club in after it, and the ball promptly whacks into the cat\'s eye. It is then revealed that Jerry lives in the hole on the golf course, and he was the one throwing the ball out. Jerry looks at Tom and draws an eyeball on the golf ball, which enrages the cat and causes him to swing at the mouse; his club misses and wraps around Tom\'s own neck. Jerry escapes temporarily, but is caught when Tom hits his golf ball onto Jerry\'s head, knocking him silly. The next scene shows that Jerry is being used as a tee and Tom places a ball on his head. Tom then readies his shot, which cuts out a huge divot while Jerry simply held onto Tom\'s club and the ball. Tom looks far off into the distance to see where his ball is, but Jerry whistles and holds up the ball. Tom then puts Jerry through the ball cleaner, and the mouse responds by spitting soapy water in Tom\'s face. Jerry is then forced into holding the tee with the ball on it; Tom hits the ball and poses with his teeth showing, which proves to be a mistake when the ball hits a huge boulder and bounces directly back the way it came, and it shatters all his teeth above and all his teeth beneath. In the next scene, Tom\'s ball is in front of two skinny, long trees. Tom cannot stand behind his ball to hit it, so he is forced to split the trees to hit his ball. The trees smash his head, apparently decapitating him, and Tom\'s body walks around and stands directly under it, somehow reattaching the head to the body. The ball ends up in a tree and triggers a ""slot machine"" display on the trunk. Three lemons appear on the reels, so Tom peeks inside the trunk, and an avalanche of golf balls comes out of the tree, tripping the cat. Annoyed at this, Tom returns to his game, but Jerry has replaced his ball with a woodpecker egg. After Tom hits the egg, the egg hatches and the bird comes back to peck on Tom\'s head, pecking out the blade of the golf club such that the head lands on Tom\'s head. Tom tries to hit another ball, but Jerry has hollowed it out such that it goes nowhere. Tom then places the shell on the chuckling Jerry\'s head and swings at the ball-mouse, which lands right next to the hole. Jerry, with the ball still on his head, dizzily prances around the hole, and Tom pokes him in after making sure that nobody is looking. Tom then takes out his scorecard and tries to figure out his score for the hole. He writes down 3 in his card , but Jerry scolds him and Tom writes 33 instead. When Tom tees off on the next hole, Jerry ties the club to Tom\'s tail; Tom ends up flying into the hole, leaving only his head exposed. Jerry sets up a putt and hits the ball toward Tom\'s mouth, then whacks the cat on the head, forcing Tom to scream in pain and swallow the ball. Jerry runs away and the incensed cat emerges from the hole, but continually runs into his own clubs. Tom then swings a ball toward Jerry with some English on it, which scoops up the mouse and brings him back to Tom. Tom swings, which sends a tiny divot with ball and mouse through the air. Jerry uses the divot like a B-52 and drops the golf ball towards Tom like a bomb. Tom digs a trench to protect himself, but the ball opens to reveal a smaller black ball, which explodes. Meanwhile, Jerry\'s divot crashes into a tree which Tom pokes at with the club; in response, the mouse grabs the club and pokes back. Tom then climbs into the tree and Jerry spanks the cat with the club, which causes the cat to peek out at the other end of the tree where a beehive is hanging. The bumblebees swarm around Tom\'s head, and he slowly realizes the situation, dives into and out of the tree, and hides in a bush. Jerry, not to be denied the pleasure of humiliating the cat, runs the bush over with a lawn mower revealing Tom shaved like a French Poodle. The bumblebees then chase Tom over a lake hazard, where a stick of bamboo is seen; Tom hides under the water and is using the stick of bamboo like a snorkel, so he can hide underwater where the bumblebees cannot reach him. Jerry then whistles to get the bumblebees\' attention, turns a \'150 yds.\' sign around to say Guess Who? and points it at the bamboo stalk. The queen bee looks through the bamboo stick to see Tom, who spits water in her face. Enraged,the queen leads the swarm on a bombing run down the stick. Jerry then places a funnel on top of the bumblebees to assist them in dive-bombing through the stick and into Tom\'s mouth. The water is shown for a few seconds, with a drum roll playing, and then all the water flies into the sky for a moment. Tom jumps out and lets out a frightening and loud scream. Jerry then takes a driver and hits a long drive, which hits Tom square on the head from a far distance, knocking him out. Repeated in Mouse Cleaning.']"

As she approaches the screen doors, she witnesses an exchange between Miyoharu and a client. The client, greatly indebted and unable to afford Miyoharu's services, is coldly and mockingly berated by Miyoharu for his presumptuousness. Enraged by the sudden demise of her affected desire for him and her mercenary attitude, he tries to assault her but is thwarted and summarily evicted by Miyoharu's servants. As he sees the client off the premises, one of the servants finds Eiko at the door and invites her inside. In supplication, Eiko reveals that the death of her mother – a geisha and close friend of Miyoharu – has left her at the mercy of her uncle, who demands that Eiko repay the debt incurred by her mother's funeral expenses by rendering sexual services to him. She pleads with Miyoharu to take her on as an apprentice maiko. Miyoharu attempts to dissuade her, on the grounds that life as a geisha is difficult and the training exceptionally arduous, but in the face of Eiko's determination she finds sympathy for the girl's situation and concedes. She sends her servant to procure the formal consent of Eiko's father, a struggling businessman, but he refuses to grant permission on the grounds that Eiko has shamed him by choosing to enter her mother's profession. Nonetheless, Miyoharu decides to allow Eiko to pursue training and enrols her in the school. While she works as a maid in the okiya, Eiko learns dance and music from her instructors, who inform her that she must work hard to maintain the high standards required of a maiko as a symbol of Japanese beauty. Within a year, Eiko has achieved the necessary level of training to be formally introduced as a maiko. In order to make the arrangements for her debut, which must be noticeably opulent in order to attract her future clientele, Miyoharu visits the proprietor of a prosperous teahouse to procure a loan of 300,000 yen. Okimi, the proprietor, grudgingly assents to assist her with the money. With the new geisha name of Miyoei, Eiko is taken round the teahouses of Gion in full formal dress escored by Miyoharu. In Okimi's teahouse, the two geishas are seated with Kusuda and his associate, who are in the process of convincing a manager on the verge of promotion to the directorship of another prosperous company, Kanzaki, to sign a contract worth 80 million yen. Kanzaki is instantly taken with Miyoharu and strokes her arm during a subsequent dance recital performed by other attending geisha. Kusuda preys upon the vulnerable Miyoei by pouring her consecutive glasses of sake that she is obliged by etiquette to drink, despite Miyoharu's remonstrations. During the recital, Kusuda takes Okimi aside and inquires as to whether Miyoharu has a patron. Failing to establish Kusuda's motives, Okimi answers that she does not. When they finally return to the okiya after a successful debut, Miyoei is totally inebriated and mocks Miyoharu for her old-fashioned 'pre-war' attitude. A package containing a congratulatory gift for Miyoei from her father implies, as Miyoharu points out, that he has relented his earlier opposition to her career as a maiko. At the geisha school, Miyoei asks her instructor about her rights as set out under the post-war constitution, and on her rights should a client desire to force himself upon her. The instructor answers that while she does indeed have these rights, it would be unthinkable for her to refuse a client. On leaving the class, Miyoei converses with a fellow student who is troubled by the efforts of her okiya to force her to take an elderly man as a patron to ensure her financial security. Elsewhere in Gion, at the shrines where they pay their respects, Okimi raises Kusuda's agenda of taking on Miyoei as her patron. Miyoharu is extremely resistant to the proposal, although when Okimi reveals that she borrowed the money for Miyoei's debut from Kusuda on the promise that he would be entitled to take her on later, Miyoharu is obliged to take it under consideration. Okimi also suggests that Miyoharu herself take on a patron, to assure her future and Miyoei's. Later, at the teahouse, Okimi tries to directly persuade the recalcitrant Miyoei to accede to Kusuda's proposal. Miyoei manages to remain aloof and promises to think on it. She flirts with Kusuda as Miyoharu entertains Kanzaki, subtly fending off his advances. The two geisha agree to accompany Kusuda to the annual music festival in Tokyo. On the train to Tokyo they encounter Miyoei's father, who has fallen on extremely hard times and tells Miyoharu that his debts have become so crippling that suicide will soon be his only resort. When they reach Tokyo, Kusuda manipulates Miyoharu into entertaining Kanzaki with the expectation that she will spend the night with him. She is extremely reluctant, but under intense pressure relents and joins Kanzaki. While she is in the other room with Kanzaki, Kusuda forces himself on Miyoei. Hearing her screams, Miyoharu runs to her rescue, and finds her in a catatonic daze on the floor with her mouth streaked with blood. Kusuda writhes on the floor in pain from the facial wounds inflicted by Miyoei as Miyoharu attempts to bind them. At Kusuda's hospital bed, his associate explains to Okimi that while they are prepared to 'forgive' Miyoei for her treatment of Kusuda, their principal concern is with Miyoharu's reluctance to aid them in seducing Kanzaki, which must be remedied before they can continue to patronise the teahouse. Okimi arranges a meeting with Miyoharu, who she sharply criticises for her insolence in thwarting a client's desires and demeaning her profession. Okimi flaunts her influence over Miyoharu, threatening to cut off her custom, but Miyoharu refuses to relinquish either herself to Kanzaki or Miyoei to Kusuda. As a consequence of her refusal, all Miyoharu's engagements are cancelled by teahouse proprietors afraid of Okimi's influence, despite district regulations prohibiting the inhibition of other establishments' custom by any one proprietor. The two geisha are forced into poverty, and Miyoharu lies in a slump at the okiya. Elsewhere in Gion, other clients and geisha mock the assault on Miyoei. Kanzaki, drunk and escorted by several other geisha, visits Miyoharu to taunt her for her stubborn coldness towards him. Miyoei's father, in a pathetic state, also pays Miyoharu a visit as his last recourse to secure a loan and save his life from his debtors. While highly critical of his hypocrisy in seeking assistance from the earnings of the daughter he disowned, she offers him her last remaining possessions. Despite Miyoharu's support for her actions to defend her rights and insistence that she maintain her dignity, Miyoei defies her and presents herself to Okimi to be taken to Kusuda. Okimi is obliged to call Miyoharu to obtain her formal consent, which Miyoharu denies. She asks Okimi to send Miyoei back to the okiya in exchange for her presenting herself to Kusuda to be given to Kanzaki. Passing Miyoei on her way to the teahouse, she bitterly berates her for insolence. After spending the night with Kanzaki, Miyoharu returns to the okiya laden with gifts for Miyoei. Wary of the sudden change in their fortunes, Miyoei demands to know whether Miyoharu prostituted herself to Kanzaki and threatens to leave if her suspicions are confirmed. Miyoharu is forced to admit that she did, but goes on to explain that her actions were in the pursuit of preserving Miyoei's dignity and innocence. She sobs as she confesses that she feels that Miyoei is her only family, and they embrace."", 'At Goro\'s Tea House we are introduced to Cho-Cho San  who is bidding farewell to her mother and grandfather. She is about to undergo training as a geisha in exchange for money that will support her family. After the relatives leave, Goro introduces Prince Yamadori, a prospective husband, to Cho-Cho San. When Yamadori finds her withdrawn, Madame Goro explains explains that Cho-Cho San is high-born and is not yet used to the geisha life style. Meanwhile, on board an American steamship due to arrive in Japan for several month\'s stay, Lieutenant Barton  convinces his friend Lieutenant Ben F. Pinkerton  that once they arrive to skip the American Counsul\'s party and plan to enjoy themselves instead. Pinkerton looks at a photograph of a blonde woman inscribed to him \'from Adelaide\' and hides it in his clothing trunk. Back at Goro\'s, Mrs. Goro prepares Cho-Cho San for another meeting with Yamadori by dressing her more elegantly. Meanwhile, Pinkerton and Barton enter Goro\'s, and are greeted by geishas. They are seated and watch a performance of dancing and music played by the geishas, and begin to become intimate with them. Goro interrupts so Pinkerton wanders to a different room and, through a screen, sees a dancing silhouette. Entering further, he discovers Cho-Cho San practicing her dancing. Despite Goro\'s admonishment, he is immediately enchanted with Cho-Cho San who runs away to the garden in fear. Pinkerton catches up to her and they talk. Yamadori comes to meet Cho-Cho San again. Goro pretends she is indisposed but a neighboring geisha reveals that she is with a naval officer. Infuriated, Yamadori vows never to set foot in Goro\'s house again. This makes Goro angry at Cho-Cho San, since Yamadori was Goro\'s best client. Goro threatens to shame Cho-Cho San\'s family because she has been disobedient. Pinkerton asks Goro to explain why he is so angry, and Goro tells him that Cho-Cho San was supposed to marry Yamadori. Barton takes Pinkerton aside and tells him that ""marriage"" to Japanese is just a formality: when husbands desert the geishas can automatically be considered divorced. Realizing how easy the situation is, Pinkerton informs Goro of his intention to marry Cho-Cho San. Cho-Cho San\'s relatives assemble at the couple\'s new house, and the marriage takes place as a tea ceremony. Afterwards, Cho-Cho San prays at her home altar, adorned with a picture of her ancestors. Pinkerton asks Barton to send the relatives away, while he gets to know Cho-Cho San better and shows her how to kiss. Several days later, Pinkerton arrives home where Cho-Cho San greets him with honors. He gives her a translucent veil. She offers him drink and a pipe to smoke. He asks for a change of pants and Cho-Cho San obliges. While searching for the pants within Pinkerton\'s trunk, Cho-Cho San discovers the picture inscribed to Pinkerton by a blonde woman . With a serious face, she brings it to Pinkerton and asks if he is in love with that woman. He denies it; she embraces him, happy again, but he maintains a serious face. Several weeks later, the home altar now shows a picture of Pinkerton. Cho-Cho San happily receives Pinkerton and Barton. In an aside to Barton, Pinkerton explains that he hasn\'t had the courage to tell Cho-Cho San that he\'s leaving the following day. Barton suggests they all have dinner at the hotel. While eating, the commander of the naval vessel visits the table, mentioning they are due to leave tomorrow. Cho-Cho San is taken aback. Returning home, Cho-Cho San is upset, so Pinkerton sings to her ""My Flower Of Japan."" The following day Pinkerton is leaving but asks Cho-Cho San not to see him off at the dock. Cho-Cho San asks about the girl in the picture but Pinkerton says he loves only Cho-Cho San and promises to come back in the spring. ""When the robins nest again?"" asks Cho-Cho San and Pinkerton affirms. The scene cuts to the next spring, and Butterfly happily holds her infant son. She points out that a robin has nested and speaks to her son, revealing his name as ""Trouble"" for now, but when Pinkerton returns, it will be changed to ""Joy."" The scene cuts to a robin building a nest. It is in the garden of a house owned by Pinkerton and the woman, Adelaide, from the photograph. A ring on the fourth finger of her left hand indicates that she is engaged. She remarks that it is now spring to Pinkerton who looks troubled. In response, she mentions that ever since he\'s returned from Japan he has been different. He offers to tell her something that might upset her and she agrees. The scene ends. In Cho-Cho San\'s home, her grandfather asks her to marry Yamadori, but Cho-Cho San explains that, unlike in Japan where desertion is ground for divorce, in the United States divorce can only be affected by a judge after a period of years. He asks her to return home, if only for the sake of the child, but she rejects her grandfather\'s ways, saying that she and the entire house belong to Pinkerton. Angrily, her grandfather disowns her and asks that she never enter his house again. Meanwhile, Pinkerton and his newly married wife Adelaide walk down the marriage aisle to the strains of Mendelssohn\'s music and rice being thrown by guests. Back in Japan, Cho-Cho San remarks that the robins have nested three times. She goes to see the American consul and asks about the nesting habits of American robins. Understanding what has happened, he explains that, in the United States, they nest only once in three years. Relieved, Cho-Cho San leaves happily. The consul sends a telegram to Pinkerton asking him to come. Meanwhile, Cho-Cho San goes to a temple to pray. Cho-Cho San sees a naval ship in the distance and is overjoyed at Pinkerton\'s imminent return, explaining it to her son. At the ship dock, Pinkerton arrives with Barton and is met by Adelaide. Barton mentions that the Consul will be having a party that night, and Pinkerton thinks that\'s why he sent the telegram. Cho-Cho San suggests to Suzuki that they surprise Pinkerton: Suzuki will be with Trouble in the next room and only bring him out at Cho-Cho San\'s clap. They sit down by the window to watch for Pinkerton\'s approach. Suzuki and Trouble fall asleep, but Cho-Cho San continues to watch all night through the morning. Suzuki wakes and encourage Cho-Cho San to go to bed. Dejected, she still believes Pinkerton will come, despite Suzuki\'s warnings that ""men always forget."" In their hotel room Pinkerton explains the situation to his Adelaide. She suggests that once he talks with Cho-Cho San, all will be cleared up. He asks her to accompany him and she assents. Pinkerton and Adelaide arrive at Cho-Cho San\'s house. He asks Adelaide to wait. He goes up to the house and is greeted by a wildly happy Cho-Cho San. Her happiness turns serious as he explains that he must leave soon and is never coming back. Cho-Cho San sees a woman waiting, and realizes that Pinkerton has married another woman - the woman she had seen in the picture. In tears, she bids him goodbye. Crying, she tells Trouble that his father has taken another woman, while Trouble fidgets with an ancestral heirloom, a knife. She then tells Suzuki to take Trouble to his grandfather who will raise Trouble ""in the ways of his ancestors."" She tells Suzuki she will follow after she prays. As she prays, she recalls the American marriage vow ""till death do us part."" She unsheathes the knife and sees the inscription ""To die with honor when one can no longer live with honor."" Wrapping the veil Pinkerton gave her around her neck, she stabs herself. Her dying words are ""I love you for always.""', '{{plot}} The disgraced former executioner, or Kogi Kaishakunin to the shogun, Ogami Ittō is now living rough on the land with his three-year-old son Daigoro, travelling the countryside as a hired killer. Pushing his son in a baby cart, he stops at a bathhouse looking for a room and a bath, and is eagerly welcomed in by a young woman. However, the manager of the house sees Ittō as a dirty vagabond and scolds the young woman for letting him in the house. Overhearing this, Ittō goes to the baby cart and retrieves a bundle and hands it to the manager for safe keeping – it is 500 gold pieces, earned from a recent job. The manager\'s tone quickly changes, but when he tries to wash Daigoro\'s feet, the boy kicks water at the old man and tromps across the floor, leaving wet footprints. Ittō\'s activities are being watched by the Kurokawa spy clan of shinobi-class ninja, which have fallen in with Ittō\'s nemesis, the Shadow Yagyū. They report on his activities to Sayaka, head of Akari Yagyū clan of female assassins. But the Kurokawa are unsure that the women are up to the task of killing Ittō. Sayaka laughs confidently and tells the Kurokawas\' leader to send their best man into the room. She then orders the man to try to exit the room. He tries to do so by grappling onto the ceiling, but the female assassins set upon him and make short work of him, hacking off his ears, fingers, arms and legs, leaving the man a writhing heap of just a torso and head before he is finally finished off. Ittō, meanwhile, is hired by a clan that specializes in making indigo dye and has a secret process. One of the clan plans to sell out the secret to the shogun. Ittō must kill him. The turncoat will be escorted by the Hidari brothers, each a master of a deadly weapon – the iron claw, the flying mace and a pair of armored gloves. As he travels to his job, Ittō encounters three groups of female assassins. The first group is disguised as an acrobat troupe that turns deadly as their gymnastic moves are combined with blades and turned against Ittō. He then encounters a pair of women who with blades on their straw hats that they throw at Ittō as if they are Frisbees. Finally, some women washing vegetables by the river turn out to be assassins and the daikons they are washing are wielded as weapons. Ittō kills them all. Then he meets Sayaka, who catches him, his son and the baby cart in a steel net. Ittō cuts his way out of the net and engages in a sword duel with her. He delivers what should be a disabling blow to her ankles, but the woman fighter jumps straight up out of her kimono to reveal a fishnet body suit and then runs away, bizarrely jogging backwards. Next, the Kurokawa clan are waiting for Ittō, who puts together his naginata  and gives the baby cart a shove toward the waiting enemies. Daigoro, still in the baby cart then activates blades in the axles of the cart, which cut off the feet of several men. The battle that ensues between Ittō and the Kurokawas is fierce and Ittō is injured before he has killed them all. Weary from the endless fighting, Ittō struggles along the road and eventually finds shelter in a shack. Daigoro, seeing that his father needs his help, must do what he can. Unable to carry water in his tiny hands, Daigoro carries water from the river in the only vessel available – his mouth. He spits the few drops he could carry between his father\'s parched lips. For food, Daigoro finds some rice cakes given as an offering to a Buddha statue and takes them for his father, leaving his vest in exchange. Ittō recovers and finds that his son is missing. Daigoro has been taken by the Kurokawa and Sayaka, tied up and suspended over a water well. If Ittō attacks, they will let go of the rope and Daigoro will plunge to his death. Daigoro lets his sandal drop into the well, giving Ittō a gauge of how deep it is. He then makes his move as the rope unspools, stopping it just in time. Sayaka watches silently and makes no move to engage the swordsman, realising his technique far outstrips her own and perhaps also out of a sense of honor for the devotion of the father to his child. Ittō then finds himself aboard a ship, carrying the three Hidari brothers. Ittō is met by several other members of the indigo-dye clan, who try to kill the Hidaris but are bloodily rebuffed. The clan then sets the ship on fire in an attempt to kill the Hidaris, but the three killers escape. Ittō tosses Daigoro and the baby cart into the water, the cart proves itself by floating. Sayaka has followed Ittō onto the ship and in the water, she tries to kill him, but is disarmed. Ittō, with Daigoro and Sayaka, find shelter, but they are cold. Ittō disrobes himself and Daigoro, then turns on Sayaka, tearing off her clothes. But he does not mean to rape her. Instead, he is seeking to get her out of her cold, wet clothes and cling to her while nude. ""Three people are warmer than two,"" he explains. She thinks about taking his sword and killing him, but the cozy scene, with Daigoro sitting between them, playfully fondling her breast, makes her abandon the plan. The final showdown takes place on a vast area of sand dunes. The Hidari brothers are at the head of a caravan of men carrying a palanquin with the indigo expert inside. The brother with the iron claw runs forward and thrusts his claw into the sand, which boils up with blood. There are men hiding in the sand. He digs his claw into the sand several times, each time creating a pool of blood and pulling up a hiding warrior by his head. The rest of the hidden men in the sand emerge and fight, but the Hidari brothers dispatch them all. Ittō awaits, alone, at the top of a large dune. Each brother is dispatched in a high-pressure spray of blood, with the last brother dispatched in a lethal stroke along the throat, a cut that sprays blood in a fine mist, while making a sound like the ""howling of the wind"". The final slain Hidari brother comments such a fabled finishing stroke is referred to as ""Mogaribue"", and wishes he had heard the sound just once from the many people he has killed, but is instead hearing it from his own neck as his life slowly drains away. Ittō approaches the palanquin with the traitorous indigo expert inside, finishing him before gathering Daigoro and again setting off. The end sees them out of the desert and on a coastal trail, followed by Sayaka. Aware of her presence Ittō stops the cart, looking straight ahead whilst holding out his dotanuki blade, as Sayaka wielding a katana is revealed behind him. Ittō stands ominously still until he hears the sound of Sayaka dropping her sword; knowing that she can never defeat the master swordsman.']"

The first segment is a relatively brief, non-narrative montage composed of war footage, propaganda footage, and battle scenes from fictional films, constantly intercut, and accompanied by classical piano. The second segment, which is relatively straightforwardly narrative, makes up the bulk of the film. It tells the story of two young women visiting a European arts conference in Sarajevo: Judith Lerner , a journalist from Tel Aviv, and Olga Brodsky , a French-speaking Jew of Russian descent. Judith interviews the poet Mahmoud Darwish  at the conference, and surveys the city, visiting the Mostar bridge, where she reads Emmanuel Levinas . Olga makes a digital-video film of the conference, is visited by her uncle Ramos Garcia , who is translating for the conference, and attends a lecture on film by Godard . The Spanish writer Juan Goytisolo also appears as himself. The third segment, a brief postlude, shows Olga walking contemplatively through a quiet lakeside setting which appears to be guarded by American soldiers.', ' The story centers on the memories of a writer Harry  who is on safari in Africa. He has contracted a severely infected wound from a thorn prick, and lies outside his tent awaiting a slow death. The loss of mobility brings self-reflection. He remembers past years and how little he has accomplished in his writing. He realizes that although he has seen and experienced wonderful and astonishing things during his life, he had never made a record of the events. His status as a writer is undermined by his reluctance to actually write. He also quarrels with the woman with him, blaming her for his living decadently and forgetting his failure to write of what really matters to him: his experiences among poor and ""interesting"" people, rather than the smart Europeans with whom he has been with lately. Despite the unwanted attentions of a witch doctor, he lives to see morning come. He watches vultures gather in a tree as he lies in the evening. He recapitulates his life and talks to his current girl-friend. He tells her about his past experiences; then arguing, then coming to realization about his attitude, and finally reaching a sort of peace, even love, with her.', 'Several strangers in Los Angeles weave their stories of loss and hope, not knowing that their lives have brushed up against each others in small but sometimes profound ways. A multi-ethnic ensemble drama, the film explores the connections between a Mexican graffiti muralist, an Armenian camera repairman, an African-American blues guitarist and an English pensioner living near the Los Angeles River. Happy is a talented teenage graffiti muralist with a passion for spray paint and hip hop. Her playground is the concrete banks of the Los Angeles River. While painting a mural of her trademark Payasa, a sad-faced Lady Clown, she encounters Sal, a mentally challenged homeless man who attempts to make contact with her. Unable to communicate with Happy, Sal then crosses paths with Avo, a vintage camera repairman living with his wife Allegra on the East Bank of the river. Their apartment overlooks Happy’s Payasa mural near the area where their four-year old daughter Heidi recently drowned. Since Heidi’s death, Avo and Allegra have not spoken. As Happy toils on the Payasa, Avo attempts to reconcile with his wife in the wake of the family tragedy. A block away from Avo’s apartment, Ridley is a struggling blues guitarist staying in an old hotel by the river. He has returned temporarily to Los Angeles to care for his mother. One night, Ridley hears an enigmatic voice coming from somewhere inside the hotel. Haunted by its mysterious presence, Ridley sets out to discover the source of the voice, running into Sal in the wake of a hit-and-run accident. Humphrey is an aging pensioner living in an apartment overlooking the ‘islands’ in the river. One morning he wakes up to the sound of Sal screaming on the sidewalk. Having recently lost his wife Ethel, Humphrey spends his days eating lunch by her grave, a few feet from Heidi’s resting place where he sees Allegra. Unsure when his time will come, Humphrey readjusts to everyday life, crossing paths with Happy as he wanders the riverside neighborhood. Connecting each character peripherally through the Los Angeles River, The Blue Hour explores the delicate ties and common humanity among strangers in a seemingly disconnected landscape.']"

They have built a big barrier of oil lanterns and watch towers that are constantly manned to keep watch for ""Those We Don\'t Speak Of."" It is explained that the villagers have a long-standing truce with the monsters; the villagers do not go into their woods, and the creatures do not enter their village. The villagers execute a well-rehearsed alarm, in which they rush home, lock their doors and hide in their cellars. The dead, skinned bodies of small animals start to appear around the village. After the funeral of a seven-year-old boy, Lucius Hunt  asks the village elders for permission to pass through the woods to get medical supplies from ""the towns"". His request is denied and later he is admonished by his mother, Alice , for wanting to go to the towns, which the villagers describe as ""wicked places where wicked people live."" The Elders seem to keep dark secrets of their own in black boxes, the contents of which they keep hidden from their own offspring. After Lucius makes a short venture into the woods, the creatures leave warnings around the village in the form of splashes of red paint  on all the villagers\' doors. Meanwhile, Ivy Elizabeth Walker , the blind daughter of the chief Elder, Edward Walker , informs Lucius that she has strong feelings for him, and he returns her affections. They arrange to be married, but things go horribly wrong when Noah Percy , a young man with apparent developmental problems who is wise to the elders\' trick, stabs Lucius with a knife that he kept hidden away in his pocket. He does this because he is in love with Ivy himself. Noah is locked in a room until a decision is made about his fate. Edward goes against the wishes of the other Elders, agreeing to allow Ivy to pass through the forest and seek out medicine for Lucius. Before she leaves, Edward explains the secret of the creatures – they are ""farce"" - bogeymen created by the Elders to keep the children from entering the woods in an attempt to keep them from leaving the village. Edward does mention, however, that ""Those We Don\'t Speak Of"" were based upon legends that he had heard at one time, of ""real creatures"" living in the woods. Ivy seems only partly convinced by this explanation, inquiring whether the skinned animals were ""also farce"". While Ivy is traveling through the forest, one of the beasts suddenly attacks her. She tricks it into falling into a deep hole to its death. The creature is actually Noah in a costume that he had found previously under the floor of the room where he was kept locked away. Ivy eventually finds her way to the far edge of the woods, where she encounters a high, ivy-covered wall. After she climbs over the wall, a park ranger named Kevin, driving a Land Rover with the words ""Walker Wildlife Preserve"" on the side spots Ivy and is shocked to hear that she has come out of the woods. He then learns that Ivy\'s last name is Walker. During this time, it is revealed that the village was founded some time in the late 1970s, when Edward Walker, professor of American History at the University of Pennsylvania, approached other people he met at a grief counseling clinic after his father had been murdered. He asked them if they wished to join him in ""an idea"" he had. From this apparently grew ""the village"", a secluded town in the middle of a wildlife preserve purchased with Edward\'s family fortune; a place where they would be protected from any aspect of the outside world and sustain themselves. The head ranger, Jay , explains to Kevin that the Walker estate pays to maintain the ranger corps, the rangers make sure no one goes into the wildlife preserve to ""disturb the animals"", the Walker estate ""paid off"" the government to keep the entire wildlife preserve a ""no-fly zone"". Kevin secretly retrieves medicine from a ranger station and Ivy returns to the village with the supplies. The Elders open their black boxes, each containing mementos from their lives from the outside world, including items related to their past traumas. All the Elders sit around Lucius\' bed. Edward points out that Noah\'s death will allow them to continue deceiving the rest of the villagers that there are ""creatures"" in the woods and all the Elders take a vote to continue living in the village. Ivy arrives, kneels at Lucius\' bedside and, clutching his hand, says ""I\'m back, Lucius.""', 'The film begins in the cockpit of a U.S. passenger airliner , shortly before they are struck from above by another airliner  on a landing approach. The pilot handles the airplane as well as he can while the flight engineer goes back to check on the passenger cabin. He comes back in the cockpit screaming, “They\'re dead! All of them! They’re burned up!” Bill Smith  is a National Transportation Safety Board investigator hired to determine whether human error is the cause of a collision of two aircraft, both of which crashed. He and his team of investigators are confused by the words on the cockpit voice recorder because there had been no fire on board before the plane hit the ground. At the same time, a theoretical physicist named Dr. Arnold Mayer  has a professional curiosity about the crash, which borders on science fiction. While giving a lecture, he talks about time travel and the possibility of visitors from the future. Time travelers are, in fact, visiting the present day and stealing passengers from doomed aircraft. Every incursion into the past causes an accompanying ""timequake"" whose magnitude is proportional to the effects of the incursion into the past. Each ""timequake"" causes physical damage in the time from which the incursion has been made. This is why they are abducting people who will not be able to affect the future any further and replacing them with copies of those who would have died. Thus, the co-pilot\'s strange comment came because all the passengers had been replaced with pre-burned duplicates in preparation for the upcoming crash.  While on one of the missions, an operative is shot and loses a stun weapon on board a plane before it crashes. This weapon winds up in the possession of Dr. Arnold Mayer, setting him on the path to working out what\'s happening. Twenty-five years later, Smith finds a similar artifact in the crash portrayed at the beginning of the film. Worried that these two individuals of the 20th century might change history by their discoveries, Louise Baltimore  travels back to 1989 in order to distract Bill Smith and discourage him from pursuing his investigation further. Louise manages to gain Bill\'s trust, as well as seduce him into a one-night stand, which she hopes will complete the distraction. However, because of still more errors on the part of the time travel team, as well as paradoxical events, Bill becomes even more suspicious. He soon pays a visit to Dr. Mayer. At that point, Louise materializes from the future and reveals her mission to both of them. In a mishap with the stun weapon, Mayer kills himself thereby causing a major change to the timeline. Louise decides to take Bill with her to the future. Between Louise\'s recent visit and exposition in the future, we find that because of pollution, the human population of the future is no longer able to reproduce, except for Louise who\'s pregnant with Bill\'s baby, though that fact isn\'t revealed until the very end of the film. This is why they have been abducting people from the past and keeping them in stasis until a future time when they will be sent into the far future. It is hoped that in this far future, the Earth will have recovered enough that humans can repopulate the planet. The recent incursion results in a force infinity timequake which will destroy the entire civilization of the ""present"" future and the Gate  itself. It is decided that it is time to send all of the people who have been collected to the distant future before the Gate is destroyed. Bill and Louise step through and disappear into the Gate, which takes them to another time and another place, in order to save their lives, and to fulfill a destiny to repopulate Earth. A simple, but poignant, message is recited by Sherman the Robot, quoting Winston Churchill, in the closing seconds of the film. As the blast wave of the gate being destroyed vaporizes Sherman he states, ""This is not the end. This is not the beginning of the end. It is the end of the beginning"" as the scene transitions to the sun rising above the clouds.', 'The film is set in the fictional town of Dante\'s Peak, Washington, located in the northern Cascade Mountains, but was actually filmed in and around Wallace, Idaho. The film is somewhat based on the real-life eruptions of Mount St. Helens in 1980 and Mount Pinatubo in 1991. The film is noted to have put emphasis on trying to accurately depict a volcanic eruption.{{cite web}} The film begins with the volcanic eruption of an unnamed volcano in Colombia  where volcanologist Dr. Harry Dalton  attempts to evacuate with his fiancée Marianne. As they begin heading out of the town, large pieces of volcanic rocks begin to crash onto the small town, one of which penetrates the vehicle and kills Marianne. Four years later, Harry is called in from vacation by his boss to investigate activity going on in the Northern Cascades region near the town of Dante\'s Peak. Meanwhile, a couple of backpackers went to the hot spring. A few minutes later, a small amount of volcanic activity had turned the hot spring sulfric, thus slowly chewing away and boiling the couple. At Dante\'s Peak, the town is receiving an award for being ""The second most desirable place to live in the United States, population under 20,000"" and celebrating its annual ""Pioneer Days Festival"". Harry meets with the town\'s mayor, Rachel Wando , who accompanies him with her two children, Graham  and Lauren , up to the mountain\'s ""high lake""  to check the acidity in the water. After checking the acidity and picking up the mayor\'s ex-mother in law, Ruth , the five of them head to the town\'s hot springs where they discover the bodies of two dead backpackers, seared by the volcanic activity under the hot springs. Just before discovering the bodies, Graham attempts to make a dive into the springs since the they were hidden by steam, but in the nick of time Harry catches him and Lauren screams, thus revealing the bodies. After evaluating the situation, Dalton calls a town meeting to discuss the option of putting the town on alert. As this occurs, Dalton\'s boss, Dr. Paul Dreyfus  shows up to evaluate the mountain and goes against Dalton\'s decision for putting the town on alert based on an economically devastating decision made in 1980 when he put the towns around Mammoth Mountain on alert without the mountain blowing. Despite feeling strongly opposed to the decision, and being asked to leave, Dalton remains in the town to help Dreyfus and his USGS crew Greg, Terry, Nancy, and Stan  evaluate the possible eruption of the mountain. Initially, tests show no sign that the mountain will erupt, and after a week the crew begins to think about leaving the town. Over the same period, Dalton forms a bond with the mayor and her children, turning romantic as the plot progresses. After the town\'s water supply becomes sulfuric due to the acidity of the mountain breaching the town\'s springs, Dalton and Dreyfus then decide to put the town on alert and call for an evacuation. Mayor Wando attempts to get her ex-mother-in-law to come down but she refuses, preferring instead to stay at the bed and breakfast she and her husband built higher up in the mountain. During the town meeting alerting the citizens to evacuate, the mountain begins to erupt, causing a stampede and a rush for the town\'s citizens to evacuate. Earthquakes cause the town and town\'s main highway to collapse and traffic jams clog the only other route out of town, causing chaos as citizens rush to escape. Meanwhile, the mayor\'s children steal her car and drive it up the mountain to their grandmother\'s cabin in hopes of getting her to come down with them. When Dalton and Wando try to reach the children, they discover them to have left for the summit to bring down their grandmother. As the eruption continues, the USGS crew prepares to depart the town and both Dalton and Wando head up the mountain after the children, only to find the grandmother still refusing to leave her home. Meanwhile, the grandmother\'s dog has run out of the house and into the woods. Down in the town, the mountain has expelled large amounts of ash and most residents have been killed or have escaped. The National Guard shows up to aid in the evacuation as news crews begin to set up camp at a safe distance to cover the mountain\'s eruption. Up the mountain, Dalton and Wando reach the bed and breakfast but don\'t initially find the children or their grandmother; after a few minutes of frantic searching they find them outside nearby, looking for the dog, and all make their way into the house where Ruth tells them to leave her alone and go back to the town. As they argue for her to come with them, a lava flow engulfs all three cars and parts of the house. The five of them flee to the nearby lake and take a metal boat across the river, leaving the dog, which was not found, behind. As they trek across, they realize that the lake has been turned to sulfuric acid and is eating through the metal boat. To keep the kids from panicking, Harry begins to sing, hoping that the boat will make it across, but as they near the other end of the lake, the boat\'s motor fails, the propeller blades were eaten by the acid. Before it reaches the shore, the boat begins to sink and Ruth jumps off to pull it along to the pier before it sinks, though doing so causes her to suffer injuries from the lake\'s acidity. She wades through the acidic water screaming, but dragging the boat along to try and save the rest of them. After evaluating her injuries, the five of them continue down the mountain with Dalton carrying Ruth on his back. Back in the town, the USGS crew, the last ones left in the town, are evacuated by the military, but a lahar  causes the small bridge to begin to break apart as they reach it. Both military vehicles, carrying the majority of people in the party, make it across, but the one USGS vehicle, driven by Dreyfus, does not make it and Dreyfus is tragically killed as the bridge is washed away. Up the mountain, Ruth asks to be put down and after a talk with the children, she dies and her body is left there as the other four continue down the mountain. At a ranger station, they hotwire a truck and use it to continue down the mountain. While doing so, they encounter a lava flow that has blocked the route; the lava has mostly cooled on top but parts of it are still visibly simmering. As they manage to cross, they encounter and rescue the grandmother\'s dog who evidently circled the lake in the woods but became trapped on a rock surrounded by the lava flow. Continuing down to the town, they discover the washed-out bridge. Realizing that they have no other means of leaving the town, Dalton heads back to the USGS makeshift operations center and picks up a tracking device from NASA that had been showcased in an earlier segment and notices that computers are signaling that the mountain is about to blow completely. Heading back to the truck he begins to head towards the town\'s mines as the mountain blows up and a giant pyroclastic cloud engulfs the town. The truck makes it safely into the mine; the town is destroyed, to the USGS crew\'s dismay, as they believe Harry has been killed. Inside the mine, Graham leads the way, as most of the abandoned mines serve as a hideout for him and his friends, and shows the survivors all of his supplies. Remembering that he left the GTD in the truck, Harry leaves to activate it. Harry reaches the truck, but there is a cave-in and Harry is injured and trapped inside the truck. The situation keeps getting worse as Harry\'s arm is broken by falling rocks and he has to reach the tracking device without causing a fatal cave-in. Eventually he reaches it and activates it. The device flashes for ""one or two days"" before the four are rescued from the mine. After being rescued from the mine by a huge team, Harry meets the rest of his crew who tell him that Dreyfus didn\'t make it and that ""he got to see the show"". Wando and her children are escorted out of the mine followed by applause from the rescue team for their survival. On board a helicopter, Graham asks Harry if he really meant what he said in the mine about taking the family fishing and Harry confirms it with the words, ""Sure did. "" He and Rachel clasp hands and kiss and Harry tells the helicopter pilot that they are ready to go. As the helicopter flies into the distance over the ruins of Dante\'s Peak, the camera turns to the volcano, and the tense theme music suggests that it may erupt again at some point in the future.']"

A diplomatic dinner is held in Moscow to celebrate the operation, at which President of the United States James Marshall  expresses his remorse that action had not been taken sooner to prevent the suffering that Radek caused and vows that the his administration will take a firmer stance against despotism and refuse to negotiate with terrorists. President Marshall, along with his wife Grace , his daughter Alice , and several of his Cabinet and advisers board Air Force One to return to the United States. A contingent of news reporters are also aboard. U.S. Secret Service agent Gibbs , acting as a mole for a group of six Soviet ultranationalist terrorists led by Ivan Korshunov , sneaks them onto the plane disguised as a Russian news crew. Once in flight, Gibbs kills several secret service agents guarding the plane\'s armory, allowing Korshunov and his men to take the armory\'s weapons and equipment and seize control of the plane. The pilots attempt to land the plane at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, but are killed and the terrorists\' pilot takes control, diverting the plane towards Kazakhstan. U.S. Secret Service agents take Marshall to an escape pod in the cargo hold, while the rest of the passengers are taken hostage. Believing the President has escaped, the hijackers separate his wife and daughter from the rest of their hostages, planning to use them as leverage. At the White House Situation Room, Korshunov contacts Vice President of the United States Kathryn Bennett  threatening to kill a hostage every half hour until Radek is released. Meanwhile, the U.S. military locates the escape pod but finds it empty. Unbeknownst to the hijackers, President Marshall, a retired military aviator, veteran of the Vietnam War, and Medal of Honor recipient, stayed aboard the plane. He contacts the White House via satellite phone, and reminds Bennett not to negotiate with the terrorists. Marshall manages to overwhelm the men guarding the hostages and develops a plan to drain the fuel from the plane, forcing the hijackers to request mid-air refueling, which would drop the plane to a low enough altitude to allow the hostages to parachute out. Though his advisers insist Marshall leave, he refuses to go without his family. When Korshunov discovers the deception, he forces the plane away, causing the fuel to ignite and destroy the fueling plane, he then captures Marshall and a few of his advisors before they can escape. With Marshall and his family held hostage, Bennett is forced to contact Russian President Petrov to issue Radek\'s release. Korshunov and his men celebrate as the event is broadcast over the plane\'s speakers, but Marshall uses the distraction to free himself. While Marshall\'s advisers deal with the remaining terrorists, Korshunov grabs Grace and disappears to the plane\'s parachute ramp, followed by Marshall. Grace manages to get away, and Marshall wrestles with Korshunov, eventually forcing his chute, wrapped around Korshunov\'s neck, to open, pulling him out of the plane and killing him. Marshall races back to the communication room to announce his freedom just as Radek is about to board a waiting helicopter. When the prison guards attempt to recapture him, Radek tries to flee but is shot and killed. Marshall directs Air Force One back towards friendly airspace, but they are soon followed by Kazakh MiG-29s piloted by Radek loyalists. Escorting U.S. F-15s fend off the attack, including one pilot that sacrifices himself to intercept a missile, but the shrapnel from the explosion destroys Air Force One\'s tail controls, sending the plane towards the Caspian Sea. A nearby patrolling U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command MC-130E Combat Talon is called in to rescue Marshall and the others via zip-line; Marshall insists his family and advisers are rescued first. Gibbs, who had remained on the plane, reveals his betrayal and kills Major Caldwell, and attempts to save himself on the last zip-line crossing before Air Force One strikes the water. Marshall overpowers him, and grabs and detaches the zip line moments before the plane explosively disintegrates on hitting the water. The MC-130E crew reel in the President, and change their call sign to ""Air Force One"" as they head back towards friendly airspace, while Marshall is reunited with his family.', 'In post-war Berlin, British Major Haven  recruits members of a returning German demolitions unit, Hans Globke , Peter Tillig , Wolfgang Sulke , Franz Loeffler , Karl Wirtz  and Eric Koertner , to defuse unexploded Allied bombs scattered throughout the city. Delighted by the well-paying position, Karl bets Eric that he will outlive him. Although initially taken aback by the wager, the other men soon agree that half of their salaries will go to the survivors of the dangerous mission in three months\' time. The British provide the men new uniforms and equipment, and assign Frau Bauer  as their liaison. Karl volunteers to lead the unit, but the men vote for the reluctant Eric instead. Later, Karl and Eric move into an Allied-approved boarding house run by pretty young widow Margot Hoefler , a French woman whose German husband died during the war. Several weeks go by in which the men successfully and safely defuse numerous bombs; then the men are stunned when young Globke is killed while defusing a British 1000-pound bomb. Suspecting that the bomb has double fuses, Eric asks Haven to request information from British armaments on its design. At the boardinghouse, Karl continually flirts with Margot, to Eric\'s annoyance. One evening when Margot loudly protests Karl\'s drunken advances, Eric bursts into Margot\'s room to help her and Karl retreats, ridiculing Eric for his motives. Deducing that Eric disapproves of her behavior, Margot explains that her uneasy situation as a traitor to the French and an outsider to the Germans has left her jaded and willing to take happiness wherever she can find it. When Eric remains critical, Margot accuses him of denying his own desires. A few days later, Frau Bauer receives a report that Tillig has been trapped under a live bomb by the partial collapse of a ruined building. With the other men away on assignments, Eric and Karl race to the site, and despite Tillig\'s protests, inspect the bomb. After Eric defuses the bomb safely, a doctor arrives and upon examining Tillig declares there is no chance for his survival. Refusing to accept the pronouncement, Eric hurries outside to request equipment to lift the bomb, but as Karl expresses his doubts, the building collapses on Tillig and the doctor. Distraught, Eric returns to the boardinghouse where he seeks solace from Margot. The next day, Eric takes Margot to another ruined section of the city and reveals that before the war he was an architect. Eric struggles to conceal his growing feelings for Margot, admitting that he is confused about becoming romantically involved while his life is in danger daily. Back at headquarters, Haven tells Eric that because of the post-war chaos, they have been unable to gather information on the thousand-pound bombs. When Haven discloses that he knows of Eric\'s former profession, Karl, unaware that his colleague was an esteemed architect, expresses surprise. Eric tells Haven that he was forced into demolitions when he fell into disfavor for making anti-Nazi political statements. Karl and the other men were all pressed into demolitions as punishment for some indiscretion and all vowed to do everything they could to survive the war. Mocking Eric\'s growing anxiety, Karl urges him to quit the unit and give up the wager, but Eric refuses. A month before the wager\'s deadline, Sulke is killed while defusing a bomb. Eric, Loeffler and the men agree to adhere to the terms of the wager but discuss giving the salaries to Sulke\'s widow and child. When Eric presents the proposal to Karl, he scoffs at the suggestion, explaining that his motto has always been to look after himself. The next day Loeffler is called to defuse a bomb found in a canal. Later, Eric learns that Loeffler has drowned in the attempt. That afternoon when Margot urges Eric to give up the bet and quit the unit, Eric explains he must know whether he can triumph over Karl\'s greed and selfishness. A few days later, Karl is assigned to defuse a thousand-pound bomb and Eric joins him at the site to make an inspection. The men discuss a strategy to avoid the potential second fuse, then Eric departs, but worriedly hovers nearby. After removing the top of the bomb, Karl gently handles the cap then abruptly calls for help, claiming the detonator pin has slipped. Eric rushes in and provides a pencil, which he offers to hold in place of the pin while Karl retrieves his tools from the landing. Moments later, Eric is stunned when the rope Karl used earlier to remove the top pulls tautly across his hand, forcing him to release the pencil. The bomb does not explode, however, and Eric realizes that Karl has tried to kill him. Eric punches Karl in the face. Once Karl gets back on his feet, he says, ""Guess it\'s still my bomb."" Eric replies, ""Still your bomb."" Eric then gets his coat and walks away. Karl resumes defusing the bomb. Once Eric is a safe distance away, the bomb explodes, killing Karl. The film closes after saluting the efforts of the ordnance removal teams, which have allowed Berlin to rebuild.', 'August 2, 1990, at dawn in Kuwait, a long succession of tanks and trucks drive toward and over the TV screen as opening credits roll, with contemporary radio news report playing. Guy Hunter, Jr., Steven Shaefer, Steve Tate, Beverly Clark, Phoebe Jeter, Jonathan Alston, Ben Pennington, Mary Rhoads, Devon Jones and Lawrence Slade are introduced to the viewer, mostly in the context of family and friends back home, while Iraq invades Kuwait, Kuwaitis resist the invasion, Saddam Hussein takes foreign nationals in Iraq prisoner as human shields, the United States progressively increases its forces in and around Saudi Arabia, Army Reserve units become activated for Desert Shield, the United Nations sets a deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, and finally, Saddam Hussein ignores that deadline up to the first commercial break. The activations mean that Ben Pennington does not get to tell his father and brother, who are off in the woods, goodbye, Phoebe Jeter does not get to see her ill grandmother for one last time, Daniel Maldonado misses the birth of his daughter, and one bride, Linda Buckholz, has to show her wedding to the guests on video. The viewer is treated to displays of American and coalition military deployment as contemporary radio news reports inform the viewer that the United Nations coalition has started to attack Iraq and occupied Kuwait as a prelude to liberating Kuwait. As Ben Pennington is deployed aboard an Air Force rescue helicopter, a hidden cameraman interviews him, and Ben replies that they are deliberately attracting Iraqi radar so AH-64 Apache helicopters can target the radars with anti-radiation missiles to clear a corridor for the bombers and simultaneously providing rescue cover in case a pilot is shot down and needs to be rescued by Ben and the crew on board. The viewer gets to hear more news reports about infrared and night vision technology and laser-guided missiles fired from planes including the F-117 Nighthawk while a Nighthawk is displayed and gun camera footage shows various targets being destroyed in a sterile, precise fashion. Another news report mentions the role played by the Navy battleships Wisconsin and Missouri while they are shown firing their {{convert|16|in|mm|0|sing8AX3Nw9Ivos&feature=related 4:11 to 5:05, ""I\'ve met Iraqi pilots, and they\'re good..."" but attributed their weaknesses to Iraqi command and control, when, once it and the radars were defeated, made the Iraqis easier to shoot down. Back home in Pennsylvania, Beverly Clark is dismayed to be activated and deployed, and shares her doubts about coming home alive with her mother. Several starving and frightened Iraqi soldiers, waving white flags and approaching the border, surrender to Crumes\' and Ford\'s Marine squad, and cringe when the Marines fire a warning shot. The prisoners are given food and medical attention as required under the Geneva Convention. In contrast, Iraq\'s treatment of coalition prisoners such as British TornadoDiscovery Channel Video, On The Inside, episode, Inside the Kill Box, narrated by Michael Ironside, released January 15, 2001. Written by Kurt Sayenga, Web reference http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309715/ pilot John Peters is shown as Iraq depicted to the news media, and new prisoner Guy Hunter is tortured under interrogation and also shown to the news media while his daughter and wife back home watch in anguish. The F-14 Devon Jones is flying is hit by a surface-to-air missile despite attempts to evade it, and both are forced to eject before the jet is engulfed in flame. Devon Jones lands in Iraq before dawn and activates his emergency transmitter. Soon Ben Pennington is out looking for him. But the Iraqis are also homing in on the rescue signal. Devon notices a truck, and then notices the Air Force helicopter. The helicopter notices the vehicle, and Devon indicates it might be a military vehicle. At least one AH-64 Apache is covering the rescue, and fires Hellfire missiles on the truck. Ben expertly disembarks from the helicopter, rifle drawn, and quickly finds Devon, does a ""fireman\'s carry"" for him, runs to the MH-53J helicopter, hands over his rifle, hands over Devon, and quickly secures Devon for liftoff while gunners watch for the enemy. Not a second after Devon is secured when the helicopter lifts off, ""inbound"" with ""survivor on board"". Devon demands to know about his backseater, Larry. Ben replies that they will know when they return to base. Indeed, Larry was captured. Crumes and Ford are enjoying some bottled water when the Battle of Khafji begins and a unit needs a Corpsman. Crumes is able to save one soldier\'s life, but reflects to Ford on the terror of war and asks if Vietnam was as bad. Ford replies that the all-volunteer U.S. military in Iraq is better trained than the U.S. military in Vietnam, but adds that the Marines will still go in first, this time like the last. After another news report and video of Scuds falling on Israel, which although attacked, must remain neutral for the sake of maintaining the international coalition including Egypt and Syria, the Patriot anti-missile system is introduced. Phoebe Jeter\'s battery saves Gary Buckholz\'s base. Meanwhile, Beverly Clark and Mary Rhoads are at a processing center for incoming U.S. soldiers, in Dhahran, which will later be hit by a Scud. Meanwhile, Private Steven Shaefer has volunteered for Desert Storm duty, and quickly upon arriving in Kuwait meets Specialist Jonathan Alston. When an explosion is heard in the distance, Alston knows that Shaefer is inexperienced in combat, and questions him about his training. Sure enough, Steven has not been prepped on chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear warfare or even on land mines, merely his basic training. When Jonathan demands to know how the Army messed up sending him into danger, Steven drops his bombshell. Alston is impressed and says they will win medals like Alston\'s uncles did in the Second World War. The ground war starts. Marine Captain Michael Shupp  instructs Ford and Crumes\' unit to fight professionally to keep one another safe, but to reserve compassion for Saddam\'s draftees deliberately sacrificed by Saddam to keep his Republican Guard in reserveDiscovery Channel Video, On The Inside, episode, Inside the Kill Box, narrated by Michael Ironside, released January 15, 2001. Written by Kurt Sayenga, Web reference http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0309715/, and promises them that they will all make it through and go home. Precision weapons save their unit when the enemy is ""danger close"". Shupp orders his men only to fire in self-defense after the enemy surrenders. Indeed, another news reporter voices over video of long lines of Iraqi prisoners of war who had been forced to fight with death squads and land mines to prevent desertion. Guy Hunter, Jr., gets tortured again after a coalition strike that scares him, and probably did more than scare his captors. Threatened with execution and blindfolded, Hunter shows no fear, and says ""just do it."" Meanwhile, Beverly Clark is winning at trivia, but pauses long enough to get a soda and chat with her best friend Mary Rhoads. Beverly tells Mary she has come to peace about being deployed in a danger zone, and Mary invites Beverly to join her for fresh air, though Beverly declines. Suddenly there is a Scud alarm. Mary starts putting on chemical warfare gear, and Beverly instructs others to do the same. However, the Patriot is not successful in annihilating the Scud, and Mary watches in horror as Beverly and her comrades are hit by the incoming warhead. Another news reporter voice-over with video of the aftermath. It is not long before the Clarks in Pennsylvania are summoned to Army Reserve headquarters, where a tactful notification of families is under way, but taking too long for the Clark parents. Beverly\'s mother found out what her husband, weeping in the senior officer\'s office, already heard from him, and despite her initial denial, she understands the truth. Alston and Shaefer get their medals when they volunteer to kill an Iraqi suicide squad ready to detonate an ammunition dump in the way of U.S. forces in Objective Utah, western Kuwait, and overcome various dangers including land mines and trip wires. Shaefer distracts the squad with his M-16 while Alston, above the trench, tosses in a hand grenade. The Basra-Kuwait ""Highway of Death"" is depicted next with more videos and voice-overs, indicating that the intent is not to destroy, but to disable the Iraqi retreat. Nevertheless, in contrast to the funeral of Beverly Clark in Pennsylvania, a significant amount of death exists on the Highway for a U.S. Army chaplain, announced by the newscaster as a rabbi, to provide appropriate Muslim rights for. By now, Hunter has been reunited with other American POWs, including Larry Slade: when one hugs Hunter, it is evident the Iraqis broke his ribs. When the Iraqis come back, they come back with cheap perfume. Hunter challenges the captors, and enraged, one threatens to shoot him, but Hunter is not going to give them the satisfaction of showing fear this time either. He replies, ""God bless America."" The U.S. troops return home to widespread jubilation, including one Linda Buckholz in her wedding gown. The celebration contrasts with Phoebe Jeter at the grave site of her grandmother. Finally, President George Herbert Walker Bush gives an address celebrating the defeat of aggression and the restoration of Kuwait to its people.']"

Liangshan\'s chief Chao Gai was ambushed and killed by Shi Wengong. His fellows vow to avenge him. The current de facto leaders of Liangshan, Song Jiang and Wu Yong, decide that given Shi Wengong\'s skill, Lu Junyi  will be the best person to assist them in taking revenge. The outlaws also note that if they succeed in recruiting Lu Junyi, they will also win over Lu\'s servant, Yan Qing, who is also a formidable martial artist. Wu Yong disguises himself as fortune teller and infiltrates the northern capital, where Lu Junyi stays, together with Li Kui, who is disguised as his idiotic assistant. They visit Lu Junyi and lie to him that a great calamity will befall him if he does not travel 1,000 miles to the southeast. Lu Junyi is skeptical of the advice and asks Yan Qing for his opinion. By then, Yan Qing has recognized Li Kui and provokes the hot-tempered Li into a fight. Li Kui is defeated and confined together with Wu Yong. Wu Yong uses reverse psychology on Lu Junyi and manages to persuade Lu to release them. Just then, Lu Junyi\'s steward Li Gu, who is in a secret affair with Lu\'s wife, reports the outlaws\' presence to the authorities so as to seize his master\'s fortune. When soldiers arrive to capture the outlaws, Lu Junyi orders Yan Qing to escort Wu Yong and Li Kui safely out while he confronts the soldiers and is arrested. Yan Qing attempts to free Lu Junyi from prison but Lu is captured again when Yan leaves him for a short while. Yan Qing travels to Liangshan to seek help and he attempts to rob two men for his travel expenses. The two men turn out to be actually outlaws from Liangshan, one of them being Shi Xiu. Shi Xiu goes to find Lu Junyi while his companion brings Yan Qing back to Liangshan. While in the city, Shi Xiu sees that Lu Junyi is about to be executed in the market square so he storms the area alone in an attempt to free Lu. Both Lu Junyi and Shi Xiu are eventually overwhelmed by soldiers and taken into captive. Meanwhile, Yan Qing meets the Liangshan outlaws and they plan to infiltrate the northern capital to save Lu Junyi and Shi Xiu. They take strategic positions around the execution ground and attack the soldiers when the prisoners are about to be beheaded. This time, the outlaws overpower the guards and swiftly take control of the area. Accompanied by the outlaws, Lu Junyi marches home and kills his disloyal steward Li Gu while his adulterous wife is slain by Yan Qing. As the outlaws leave the city, they run into Shi Wengong and his men, resulting in both sides clashing in an immense battle. Shi Wengong\'s forces are routed so he challenges the outlaws to engage him and his five students in man-on-man duels. The five students fight with Lin Chong, Li Kui, Hu Sanniang, Guan Sheng and Shi Xiu, while Lu Junyi faces Shi Wengong. By the time the five heroes had defeated Shi Wengong\'s students, Lu Junyi was still locked his duel with Shi. Yan Qing and Li Kui join in the fray and Shi Wengong is injured gravely but still remains alive. After declaring that Lu Junyi is now the new leader of Liangshan, Shi Wengong stops everyone from approaching and commits suicide. The outlaws, seeing that their quest for vengeance is now complete, ride back to their stronghold and the film ends.', 'In a small village named Rack-Armor Terrace in Hebei, at the foot of the Great Wall of China, a local peasant called Ma Dasan  is caught by surprise when a man bursts into his home one night and deposits two men in gunnysacks, instructing him at gunpoint to keep them captive but alive for the next few days and interrogate them. The man, identified only as ""Me"", leaves before Ma can catch a glimpse of him. One of the gunnysacks contains Kosaburo Hanaya , a belligerent Japanese sergeant; the other Dong Hanchen , an obsequious Chinese interpreter working for the Japanese Army. Ma hurriedly enlists the help of his fellow villagers. Fearing both the mysterious ""Me"" and the Japanese, the village decides to follow the instructions from ""Me"" and detains the prisoners in Ma\'s cellar. Hanaya repeatedly attempts to provoke the peasants into killing him, but Dong, fearing for his own life, alters Hanaya\'s words in translation to make him appear conciliatory. The mystery man fails to return by the eve of Chinese New Year as promised. Six months later, the villagers finally run out of patience and resolve to kill the prisoners. The task falls on Ma after a drawing of lots. Not daring to commit murder, Ma instead hides the prisoners in a watchtower along the Great Wall, where he visits them regularly to bring them food and water. However, an unsuccessful escape attempt by the prisoners reveals Ma\'s secret to the rest of the village. A bitter argument ensues and the village decides to hire an assassin from town to carry out the deed. Ma enlists the help of an old man known as One Stroke Liu , a former Imperial executioner. He is told that being beheaded by Liu feels like a passing breeze, and that the severed head will roll nine times on the ground, blink three times, and smile in a gesture of gratitude for such a painless death. However, Liu fails to harm either prisoner with one stroke. Claiming that it is the will of Heaven, Liu leaves with the prisoners uninjured. By this time, however, Hanaya has lost all his defiance and is filled only with gratitude towards the villagers. He promises to reward the village with two wagons of grain should he be released. The villagers agree and return the prisoners to the Japanese Army encampment in the nearby town. However, the Japanese Army has already made Hanaya a war hero, believing that he was killed in battle. Returning alive after being a prisoner shames the Army. The commander of the encampment, Captain Inokichi Sakatsuka , gives Hanaya a merciless beating but feels honor-bound to fulfill the agreement between the latter and the village. Captain Sakatsuka and his men bring a great bounty of food and wine to the village and hold a feast there that evening, as Ma goes off to fetch his lover Yu\'er  from a neighboring village. During the feast, Captain Sakatsuka demands to have the man who captured Hanaya. He also accuses Ma of sneaking off to fetch resistance fighters. Not given a satisfactory answer, he orders all villagers to be killed and the village to be burned. Ma and Yu\'er return on a raft only to find the entire village in flames. Meanwhile, Hanaya is about to commit harakiri before being stopped by Captain Sakatsuka and informed that Japan has recently surrendered, and the war is over. After the Chinese National Revolutionary Army takes back the area, Dong is publicly executed for collaborating with the enemy. Ma, bent on revenge, disguises himself as a cigarette vendor and loiters outside the Japanese encampment, now converted into a POW camp. When two Japanese soldiers come out to buy cigarettes, Ma hacks them with an axe and breaks into the camp, killing more POWs. He finds and pursues Hanaya, but is brought down by guards before he can kill the latter. Major Gao ([[David Wu , commander of the Chinese Army contingent administering the town, condemns Ma\'s act as too despicable to deserve death by the hands of a Chinese soldier, and instead orders a Japanese POW to carry out the execution before a massive crowd. Captain Sakatsuka hands a katana to Hanaya, who takes careful aim before delivering the fatal strike. As Ma\'s head falls to the ground, it rolls nine times, blinks three times, and smiles, just as \'One Strike\' Liu\'s victims were supposed to have done.', 'The film is based on Yu Hua\'s novel To Live. The story begins some time in the 1940s. Xu Fugui  is a local rich man\'s son and compulsive gambler, who loses his family property to a man named Long\'er . His behaviour also causes his long-suffering wife Jiazhen  to leave him, along with their daughter, Fengxia and their unborn son, Youqing. After he loses his entire family fortune, Fugui eventually reunites with his wife and children, but is forced to start a shadow puppet troupe with a partner named Chunsheng , using puppets donated by Long\'er to support his family. The Chinese Civil War is occurring at the time, and both Fugui and Chunsheng are conscripted into the Kuomintang during a performance. Eventually Fugui is able to return home and explain his absence, only to find out that Fengxia has become mute and lost most of her hearing due to a fever. It is revealed that Long\'er did not want to donate any of his wealth to the ""people\'s government"", and when they tried to pressure him to do so, they only enraged him further so that he decided to burn all of his property instead of giving it away. He was designated an anti-revolutionary reactionary and executed. Fugui realizes the serendipity of losing their fortune to Long\'er, for he could have been executed had he not lost it in their bet. The ending of this decade shows Fugui and Jiazhen locating the certificate Fugui earned after fighting in the war in the wash. It is symbolic of their family for the certificate is fragile, much like the family, and the two try to carefully unfold it so they can hang it in their house to show that they are a revolutionary family despite their past wealth. The story moves forward a decade into the future, to the time of the Great Leap Forward. The local town chief enlists everyone to donate all scrap iron in their possession, including cookware, to the national drive to produce steel and make weaponry for retaking Taiwan. As an entertainer, Fugui performs for the entire town, and so is allowed to keep the small pins that hold his puppets together. The town, which has been devoted entirely to producing steel, also establishes a communal kitchen for everyone to get food from. Soon after, some boys have begun picking on Fengxia, who cannot fight back or tell anyone since she cannot speak. Youqing, who adores his older sister, decides to get back at one of the boys by dumping a huge bowl of noodles and chili sauce onto his head at the public kitchen. In the fury afterward, one man accuses Youqing, and by default, Fugui, of trying to sabotage the kitchens. Since Youqing will not apologize, Fugui begins to paddle him. Later, when they have returned home, Fugui learns of the reasons of his son\'s actions, and tries to apologize, only to be rebuffed. That night, when he is giving another shadow play to the workers, he asks Jiazhen to convince Youqing to come see it, as a way to make it better between them. In the end, Youqing does come, and with a bowl of tea for his father. But only because his mother has given him the idea of putting vinegar and chili sauce in it, as well as helped him, as a way of payback. In the end, Fugui ends up ragingly and eventually playfully chasing his son around the smelting area. The mother\'s actions also made it look like the child was just a prankster, and possibly to make the people no longer think Youqing\'s actions was sabotage set up by Fugui. One day a while later, while Fengxia and Youqing are sleeping, several of Youqing\'s classmates come by to tell him that they have to go to school now, since the District Chief is coming. Still sleepy, Fugui carries him there, despite his wife wishing to let him sleep, since he has not been able to sleep well in weeks. Tragically, the boy falls asleep against a wall, which the District Chief\'s truck accidentally knocks over, killing Youqing. At the grave site of the boy, his mother leaves for him a lunchbox of 20 stale dumplings, which were intended as his lunch for school that day, plus 20 newly made dumplings. The District Chief visits the family at the grave, only to be revealed as Chunsheng. His attempts to apologize and compensate the family are rejected, with Jiazhen declaring that he owed them a life. The story moves forward again another decade, to the Cultural Revolution. The village chief advises Fugui\'s family to burn their shadow puppet drama props, which have been deemed as counter-revolutionary as they are representative of traditional Chinese culture. Fengxia is now grown up. Her family arranges for her to meet Wan Erxi, a local leader of the Red Guards who also has a disability. They fall in love and soon marry, and Fengxia becomes pregnant. It is revealed that Chunsheng, the district chief, has been branded a reactionary and a capitalist. Throughout the years, Fugui had forgiven Chunsheng, but Jiazhen does not want to see him. He arrives late at night to inform Fugui and Jiazhen that his wife has committed suicide and implies that he plans to do so also as he was unable to cope with both losing his wife and killing Youqing. Chunsheng gives Fugui the bank certificate for all of his money as a form of his final apology and wished that they accept the money before his death. Fugui refuses to take it, and Jiazhen, who up to that point had refused to talk to Chunsheng, reconciles with him and encouragingly tells him to keep living, because ""You still owe us a life!"" Months later, during Fengxia\'s childbirth, her parents and husband accompany her to the county hospital, where they find out that young medical students are in charge. Since all doctors have been sent to do hard labor for being ""reactionary academic authorities"", the students are left as the only ones in charge, despite being so young. The nurses tell the family that both the child and mother will be fine, but the family is skeptical. Wan Erxi manages to retrieve a doctor from confinement to oversee the birth. As the doctor has not eaten for several days, Fugui purchases seven steamed buns  for him. Fugui and Jiazhen decides to name the son Mantou, after the buns, or at least until he is born. Soon, a healthy baby boy is born, and everything seems to have gone perfectly. However, Fengxia begins to hemorrhage, and the nurses panic, admitting that they do not know what to do. The family and nurses seek the advice of the doctor, but find that he has overeaten and is semiconscious. The family is helpless, and Fengxia bleeds to death. Her parents decide to keep the baby\'s name as Mantou, or ""little bun"". The movie ends six years later, with the family now consisting of Fugui, Jiazhen, their son-in-law Erxi, and grandson Mantou. The family visits the graves of Youqing and Fengxia, where Jiazhen, as per tradition, leaves dumplings for her son. Erxi buys a box full of young chicks for his son, which they decide to keep in the chest formerly used for the shadow puppet props. When Mantou inquires how long it will take for the chicks to grow up, Fugui\'s response is a more tempered version of something he said earlier in the film, that the chickens would grow into geese, which would grow into sheep, which would grow into oxen. However, in spite of all of his personal hardships, he expresses optimism for his grandson\'s future, and the film ends with his statement, ""and life will get better and better""  as the whole family sits down to eat.']"

Almost immediately, there is tension between the couple as David becomes immersed in his academic work and differing ideas regarding the nature of their relationship come to light: David wants the traditional division of tasks, with the man earning wages, and the wife satisfying his needs in the kitchen and bed. Amy wants greater participation from David if she is going to accept such a role: she wants him to perform all the traditionally male tasks, like fixing the toaster, but also to involve himself in her community. Chris Cawsey ([[Jim Norton , Norman Scutt , Riddaway , and Amy\'s former lover, Charlie Venner , are Wakely locals hired to renovate the Sumners\' isolated farmhouse. They openly resent David for his intellectual pursuits, and persistently harass him. When Amy discovers their cat strangled and hanging by a light chain in their bedroom closet, Amy claims the workmen did it to intimidate David. She presses him to confront the villagers, but he refuses. David tries to win their friendship, and they invite him to go hunting in the woods the next day. During the trip, David is taken to a remote forest meadow and left there, after the workmen promise to drive the birds towards him. Having ditched David, Venner returns to the couple\'s farmhouse where he rapes Amy. Scutt arrives, forces Venner to hold Amy down, and rapes Amy as well. After several hours, David realizes he\'s been tricked and returns home to find a disheveled and withdrawn Amy. She does not tell him about the rapes. The next day, David fires the workmen, claiming that they have performed poorly and wasted time. Later that week, the Sumners attend a church social where Amy becomes distraught after seeing the men who raped her. They leave the social early, and, while driving home through thick fog, accidentally hit the local village idiot Henry Niles ([[David Warner , whom they take to their home. David phones the local pub about the accident. However, earlier that evening Niles had accidentally strangled a flirtatious young girl from the village, Janice Hedden , and now her father, the town drunkard, Tom , and the workmen looking for him are alerted by the phone call to Niles\'s whereabouts. Soon the drunken locals, including Amy\'s rapists, are pounding on the door of the Sumners\' home. After a few minutes of their breaking the windows and hammering on the door, the local magistrate, Major John Scott , arrives and after attempting to defuse the situation, is shot dead by Tom. At this point the father and the workmen agree that they cannot go back on what they have done, but only continue. David realizes that they will not allow anyone in the house to live and begins preparing to defend his home. First he heats two saucepans of cooking oil. Then, when one of the locals attempts to enter through the window, he ties his hands together at knifepoint. As more men appear at another window, he scalds them with the boiling oil, temporarily incapacitating them. Then he lays down a large mantrap in his living room and sends Amy upstairs to hide. When Tom and Cawsey enter and attempt to shoot David, he knocks the shotgun out of Tom\'s hands, causing it to fire and mangle the man\'s foot, mortally wounding him. He then engages in a fight with Cawsey, beating him to death with a fire poker. Finally, Charlie appears and holds David at gunpoint, but before he can shoot him, the two hear Amy screaming. As they both run upstairs, the fifth man, Scutt, is there. He tells Charlie to take David downstairs and kill him, so they can rape Amy again. Instead, Charlie shoots Scutt and David begins to fight Charlie. As they reach the living room, David, despite Amy\'s pleas not to, kills Charlie by springing the mantrap over his head, crushing his neck. As David looks at the carnage around him, he murmurs, ""Jesus, I got \'em all."" He is then attacked by another villager and, losing the struggle, asks Amy to fetch the shotgun and shoot him. Amy hesitates before retrieving the weapon and shooting the villager. David is driving Niles to town when the latter turns and says, ""I don\'t know my way home."" David smiles and replies, ""That\'s okay. I don\'t either.""', 'The film takes place in Neu Posen, German East Africa sometime before the First World War. ""Mamba"" is the name given to a South African snake. The reptile of this adventure is Auguste Bolte , who is constantly reminding those with whom he has a chance to converse that he can buy anything. He neglects his appearance and does not even bother to shave or brush his hair. The German officers hold themselves aloof from him and the only individual he has an opportunity to talk to at length is his valet-secretary, a Cockney, who feeds his master with flattery. One afternoon Bolte recalls that he has received a letter asking for $100,000 from Count von Linden. The Count is in Germany and in a footnote it is written that Bolte might marry von Linden\'s daughter. Helen. The white people of the post have as little to do with Bolte as possible and the British officers across the frontier also spurn him. It occurs to Bolte that a beautiful wife would perhaps help to make life more agreeable for him. He thinks also that the officers would then overlook some of his failings and be quite impressed. He therefore allies himself to Germany. Helen , like most daughters who marry wealthy villains in melodramas, does so to save her father from ruin. There is a flash of the wedding and soon Helen and her ignoble husband are seen aboard the steamship bound for East Africa. On the same vessel is Karl von Reiden, the officer who is to take charge of the Neu Posen post. He is not averse to a little flirtation with a beautiful woman and therefore when Helen goes out on deck to avoid Bolte, Karl succeeds in meeting her. These scenes are fairly well filmed and the color effects are capital. Karl, played by Ralph Forbes, is a handsome fellow. So soon as he knows that Bolte is Helen\'s husband he realizes that the marriage is not to her liking. Later these passengers are on the river boat, and when that craft reaches Neu Posen. Bolte stands on the aft deck hoping to make all the German officers envious of his attractive bride. He later gives a feast and takes good care to make a show of his wealth, even to having a procession of natives carrying the viands. A visit from a native woman interrupts the proceedings, and in a subsequent passage Bolte, enraged with his wife, is about to flog her with a whip when Karl comes to the rescue. All this happens just prior to the World War, and in the closing chapters word is received by both the Germans and the British that hostilities have been declared. Bolte, the snake, believes that money can buy his freedom from military service, but soon he learns otherwise. He is compelled to don a uniform and then decides to run away. His end is sudden, for he fires at one group of natives without knowing that others are behind him. They know something about Bolte and his pleas for his life fall on deaf ears. There follow episodes in which Karl goes to the rescue of Helen and others, who are in danger of an attack by the natives. These are pictured with due attention for red blood on the hero\'s shirt. It seems that the Britishers might have been more solicitous about Karl\'s wounds, but all the British commandant says when he comes up to Karl is to ask him whether he will have another Piccadilly cigarette.', 'In 1931, Lon Rambeau sends his daughter Elizabeth Rambeau away from London to Napa Valley, California to visit Lon\'s father Philippe Rambeau and Phillipe\'s sister Martha Fairon, owners of vast vineyards and a grand estate. Philippe and Martha welcome Elizabeth lavishly, then reveal the real reason for the celebration of her arrival: her betrothal, unknown to Elizabeth, between her and her cousin, Andre Swann. John Rambeau, obviously disliked by matriarch Martha, arrives at the party, flirts with Elizabeth and leads her out into the vineyards, where he mischievously reveals Rambeau family secrets: Philippe uses marriage to tighten the family hold on the valley; Phillipe\'s sister Martha and daughter Charlotte  had been married off to local landowners in order to increase the vineyard holdings &mdash; Phillipe now wants to marry off grand-daughter Elizabeth to Andre in order to absorb the Stag\'s Leap Winery . Continuing his explanation, John points out his house nearby, where his invalid mother Charlotte now lives, and says that he now knows that Martha\'s husband  is his real father, even though everyone claims that Charlotte\'s late husband had been the biological father to both John and his sister Monica. John then takes the speechless Elizabeth into his arms and kisses her, but she pulls away and runs into the house. The next day, John gets into an argument with Philippe by insisting that they ignore Prohibition laws and sell their grapes  to bootleggers. Philippe, who loves John, insists on remaining lawful, explaining once again how he will continue to cultivate and study wines until the time comes to sell them legally. John volunteers to show Elizabeth around the winery, bitterly pointing out the vast stores of wine going to waste. When he asks her about her past and tries to kiss her again, she once again pulls away. As they wander the estate, one of the female workers, Buz Dietrick, flirts with John. Back at the house, Martha spirits Elizabeth away to a lunch with Andre, who is quite comfortable with the idea of an arranged marriage. Meeting with the local association of grape growers, John tells them that he will make them rich by selling their grapes to a syndicate in Chicago. Some of the traditional growers insist on gaining Philippe\'s approval first. Ignoring them, John leaves for Chicago to meet with the syndicate &mdash; soon after, thugs arrive in the Napa Valley and force the growers to sign contracts. When John returns to Napa months later, the growers, now grown rich from John\'s arrangement with the Chicago syndicate, welcome him warmly. John meets the growers at a nightclub, where he finds Buz sitting with her boyfriend, Luigi Griffanti. They all watch Elizabeth and Andre  dance. John once again romances Elizabeth, who, hoping to dissuade his interest, reveals to him that her father had sent her away from England because she had been involved in a torrid love affair with a cruel man, and she now desires a safe marriage with Andre. A jealous John accuses her of ""prostituting"" herself for real estate, and she slaps him. John then turns to Buz for comfort, convincing her to leave Luigi and drive off with him. Later, Andre drives Elizabeth home, where he confesses that he is growing to love her. Inside, Martha, aware of Elizabeth\'s ambivalent feelings over John, confronts her about her past, urging her to marry Andre before he realizes he is getting ""damaged goods."" John returns home and tells his mother he will leave the next day for Chicago. The next day Elizabeth, having had a change of heart, races off to see John before his train leaves &mdash; she finds him at the station and tells him she loves him. Thrilled, John insists that she wait for his return. A few months later, a pregnant Buz shows up at the estate to inform Phillipe that the baby is John\'s &mdash; Buz and her father blackmail Philippe. Elizabeth, nearby, hears all, and collapses with grief. Martha directs Buz to tell Luigi the baby is his. Buz and Luigi soon marry, but she fights with both him and his mother when they want to name the baby Cesare, and she wants to name the baby ... John. Months pass. Martha tries to convince an impatient Andre to wait for Elizabeth to set a wedding date. When John finally returns to Napa Valley, Elizabeth is up in the mountain orchard with Philippe, listening to him explain that this is sacred ground to him, as it was his first plot of land, and his beloved wife is buried here. At the estate, Martha greets John coldly and warns him that he must now conduct business through her, because Philippe is ill. After successfully persuading Martha that they can make millions by selling the Rambeau grapes to the Chicago syndicate, John drives to the mountain orchard. There, Philippe, horrified by John\'s shady dealings, commands him to leave, as does Elizabeth, who tells him she knows the truth about Buz\'s baby. Protesting that he can prove that Buz has lied, John races away, accidentally throwing a lit cigarette into the parched fields, starting a blaze. By the time the fire is noticed, it is too late, and the out-of-control wildfire destroys most of the mountain orchard. Unaware of the fire, John rushes to Buz\'s house, where mother-in-law Griffanti, upon hearing John\'s name, figures out that John is her grandson\'s actual father. As Buz agrees that she will tell Elizabeth that the baby is not John\'s, Luigi, at his mother\'s urging, attacks John in a jealous rage. John manages to get away, but Luigi pulls out a gun and shoots him. At the hospital, John is diagnosed with temporary partial paralysis &mdash; when Elizabeth visits to beg his forgiveness, he turns away from her bitterly. Soon, he is able to walk with crutches, and returns home, where he tells his uncle Francis and mother Charlotte that he knows about their affair, which resulted in his birth. John takes the blame for the orchard fire &mdash; in return, he forgives the two of them for their deceit, and asks for their forgiveness in exchange. Months later, Philippe dies, and matriarch Martha gathers the family together for the reading of the will. To Martha\'s shock and dismay, Philippe has divided the estate equally between his children and grandchildren &mdash; he also leaves the mountain orchard to John, the valley vineyards to the still-unmarried Elizabeth, and nothing to Martha. Although Martha is greatly pained by what she sees as an injustice, both she and her husband Francis realize that now she will finally be more interested in her husband and her marriage, instead of the family business. Within a few weeks, John has restored his mountain orchard to health. One day, Elizabeth joins him with a gift: a grape vine cutting from her valley vineyard. They graft the valley cutting onto a mountain vine, talk about the melding of ""valley sweetness"" with ""mountain strength"", and, finally, fall into each other\'s arms, declaring their love for each other.']"

Before she enters her sophomore year in high school, she spends the summer moping around her family cottage. She suffers from her mother\'s put-downs, while hearing nothing but praise for her older sister, June. Her father somehow manages to float around the family tensions. She also helps paint the cottage, just as her mother constantly demands her to. Connie passes the time cruising shopping malls with her friends and flirting with boys. When an actual date leads to heavy petting, however, she flees from his car. At a hamburger joint, an older man confides to her, ""I\'m watching you!"" and proves it soon after. One afternoon, her mother and June warn Connie to be careful with her flirting, and she is left alone in the cottage, while her family goes to a barbecue. Later, as Connie is playing around the house, a man who calls himself Arnold Friend approaches her in a 1960s convertible with that name painted on it and identifies himself as ""A. Friend"". He dresses and acts like James Dean, and name-drops several teenybopper acts, even though he is much older than she is. He comes off very kind and friendly, but a bit suspicious, alternating between talking to her in a warm, seductive voice and shouting insults to his fellow car passenger when he asks Arnold if he should ""pull out the phone,"" possibly to keep her from calling the police. Arnold tells Connie about how he has been watching her and that he knows all about her, recounting the details about her family\'s barbecue plans with amazing accuracy. He then starts talking about how he could be her lover. She starts to get scared and tells him to go, but he coerces her into going with him, threatening to burn down the house, while his friend remains in the house. When she returns home, Connie is bewildered and disheveled, but tells Arnold that she never wants to see him again. It is left ambiguous whether or not he raped her; it is implied that she isn\'t the same person we met at the beginning of the film. After her family returns home, her mother tearfully apologizes to her for slapping her, but Connie reassures her that everything is all right. At the end of the film, she never tells June about what happened, but dances with her to James Taylor\'s recording of the song ""Handy Man.""', 'The lifelong feud between Max  and John  has cooled; they continue to call each other ""moron"" and ""putz"", only now with affection. Their children, Melanie  and Jacob , have become engaged after a brief relationship. Meanwhile, John is enjoying his marriage to wife Ariel , which occurred at the end of the first film. The spring and summer fishing season is also in full swing in Wabasha, Minnesota, with the annual quest to catch ""Catfish Hunter"", the lake\'s largest catfish, consuming the fishing community. However, the local bait shop closed after the death of its proprietor Chuck in the first film. New arrival to Wabasha, Maria Ragetti , has purchased the building with the intent of converting it into a fancy Italian restaurant. Max and John join forces to try to sabotage the restaurant and succeed to a point, enough to make Ariel force John to go over to the restaurant and apologize to Maria for what he\'s done. Originally, John doesn\'t want to do it, and is encouraged by Max to tell Ariel so, which results in John moving in with Max as Ariel throws him out of the house. John eventually breaks down, and goes to apologize to Maria after realizing that Max lives a slovenly  lifestyle at his home. Things go awry, however, when John and Maria trade shots of grappa over the conversation. He tells her that he\'s happily married with Ariel for six months. Maria mentions that her marriage with Antonio ended badly before it began. Eventually, John drinks too much and passes out, waking up the next morning in the restaurant, leading Ariel and Max to believe that the two slept together. However, Maria\'s mother Francesca  stops the confrontation by revealing three things; the first is that she and John\'s father are in a relationship, Maria has no interest in John and is in fact infatuated with Max, to everyone\'s surprise. While out in his boat one day Max finds Maria on the lake fishing, and the shared interest helps to begin a romance between the two. However, Maria calls it off, thanks to Francesca reminding her of five failed marriages in the past, and Max is bewildered and disappointed. To complicate things further, Jacob and Melanie\'s wedding plans are causing the couple stress because of their fathers\' apparent inability to plan a proper wedding. After John decides to book ""Handsome Hans"", Wabasha\'s ""polka king"" for the wedding, Melanie finally snaps and she and Jacob get into a huge argument, which results in the wedding being called off and the two to live separately. Upon hearing the news, John and Max call off their truce and reignite their feud. Once again, Max and John resort to childish pranks to get back at each other, which include: Max broadcasting a video of John sitting still, naked, for a statue Ariel was making of him, Max disconnecting John\'s outboard motor, John cutting Max\'s fishing net and boat anchor line, and John\'s cat Slick spending the night inside Max\'s truck clawing the ""authentic imitation leather"" on the seats. This leads to the climax of the feud. Max adopts a one-eyed bulldog named Lucky, who chases Slick into John\'s house, messing up the house, and causing the statue of John to break. Seeing the destruction of the statue, Ariel moves out, telling John she isn\'t coming back until the two are done fighting. In addition, Max had another date scheduled for Maria, but her mother will not let her go because Maria has been heartbroken five times in her past marriages and she fears that Max will make it six. Maria does not show up for their date and Max tries in vain to get in contact with her. Saddened over Ariel leaving and moving in with Melanie, John goes to the lake to fish with his father  and get some advice of what to do about what had just happened. However, Grandpa has died on the couch he used to fish on. At his funeral, his ashes are scattered in the lake, in front of everyone. Max and John call off their feud again when they bond over John\'s father. The two also help Jacob and Melanie reunite after their brief estrangement and the wedding is apparently back on. Before leaving to reconcile with Ariel, John convinces Max to try again with Maria, telling him to ""park that stupid pride of his"" and tell her how he really feels. Max decides to visit Maria at Ragetti\'s. Max stops to see Maria, but her mother refuses to let him in. He doesn\'t give up and comes in anyway by telling Francesca that he refuses to leave until he sees her. Maria doesn\'t want to see him, but she eventually comes out. She comes clean by telling Max the truth on how many times she\'s actually been married. He was only aware of one marriage, to a man named Antonio and could be implied that John told him about it. Max decides then to explain to Maria he\'s not like the other 5 men she was with and that he knows how to treat a lady. In telling her how he truly feels, the two rekindle their romance. Much like the first film, a wedding is to take place at the end. On the way to the wedding, however, Max and John see a fellow fisherman named Sven, who has come in contact with Catfish Hunter and is staggering around bewildered after being unable to catch him. Max convinces John that they should take one more try at catching the fish, considering his boat is nearby. John agrees, and the two set out to catch Catfish Hunter in spite of all the damage John did to Max\'s boat earlier in the film. The two manage to reel in the large catfish and have him in the boat, but John says that they should throw him back. Max thinks he\'s nuts, but John reminds him that his father had been trying to catch Catfish Hunter for twenty years, and the two should be in the lake together. Therefore, Catfish Hunter is returned to the lake and the duo rushes to the church for the wedding, which turns out to be Max\'s wedding to Maria . Max and Maria are wed and drive away in the limousine to their reception to be held at Maria\'s restaurant, which will also serve as the town\'s bait shop again. As in the first film, a trick is played on the newlyweds in the limo on the way to the reception. Max and Maria were kissing and looked up to see Lucky looking back. They are startled at first, but realized that they\'re smelling Lucky. John had put the dog in the front seat to stink up the limo as revenge for the prank Max pulled on him with a dead fish.', 'In 1912, Broadway star Don Hewes  is buying Easter presents for his sweetheart, starting with a hat and some flowers . He goes into a toy shop and buys a cuddly Easter rabbit, after persuading a young boy to part with it and buy a set of drums instead . Hewes takes the gifts to his dancing partner, Nadine Hale , who explains that she has an offer for a show that would feature her as a solo star. Don tries to change her mind and it looks as if he has succeeded , until Don\'s best friend, Johnny , turns up. Nadine reveals that she and Don are no longer a team and it becomes obvious that Nadine is attracted to Johnny. Angry, Don leaves to drown his sorrows at a bar. Johnny follows him and tries to persuade him to talk to Nadine, but to no avail; Don brags that he does not need Nadine and that he can make a star of the next dancer he meets. After Johnny leaves, he picks out one of the girls dancing on the stage, Hannah Brown , and tells her to meet him for rehearsal the next day. Hannah then performs a duet, singing a musical number with a member of the band  on trombone, ""I Want to Go Back to Michigan."" The next morning, Don tries to turn Hannah into a copy of Nadine, teaching her to dance the same way, buying her dresses in a similar style and giving her an ""exotic"" stage name, ""Juanita."" However, Hannah makes several mistakes at their first performance and the show is a fiasco. Hannah meets Johnny, who is instantly attracted to her and sings ""A Fella With An Umbrella"" while walking her to her rehearsal with Don. At the rehearsal, Don, realizing his mistake, decides to start over from scratch by creating routines more suited to Hannah\'s personality. Hannah sings ""I Love A Piano"" and she works out a dance routine with Don that proves much more successful than their earlier performance. The duo, now known as ""Hannah & Hewes"", are shown to be performing ""Snookie-Ookums"", ""The Ragtime Violin"", and ""When That Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves For Alabam\'"" in a montage of their performances. At an audition for Ziegfeld Follies, where they perform ""Midnight Choo-Choo"", they meet Nadine who is starring in the show. Hannah realizes that Nadine was Don\'s former dancing partner and demands to know if they were in love. Don hesitates and Hannah runs out of the rehearsal where she encounters Johnny. Later, Don meets Hannah back at the hotel and reveals that he turned down the Ziegfeld offer, believing that Hannah and Nadine do not belong in the same show. Johnny soon arrives and takes Hannah out for dinner at which, after a comical routine by the waiter, Johnny reveals that he has fallen in love with Hannah. While Hannah does like Johnny, she admits she is actually in love with Don; she also admits to deliberately making mistakes when they rehearse so she can be with him longer. She and Johnny continue to have a close friendship. Meanwhile, Nadine\'s show opens and Don goes to see it . He is the only member of the audience who seems unimpressed. Later on, Don goes to see Hannah and tell her that they will be starring in another show and invites her to dinner to celebrate. Hannah goes to dinner at Don\'s, only to have him suggest a dance rehearsal. She is immediately upset and turns to walk out, telling him that he\'s ""nothing but a pair of dancing shoes"" and that he doesn\'t see her as a woman, but as a dancing aid. Hannah is particularly annoyed that Don doesn\'t notice her new clothes and all the effort she has made for him. She tries to leave, but Don stops her and kisses her. Hannah then plays the piano and sings ""It Only Happens When I Dance With You,"" after which Don realizes he is in love with Hannah and they embrace. The couple take part in a variety show, with a solo by Don  and then comes the most famous musical number in the film , in which Don and Hannah play a pair of street urchins with vivid imaginations. Don and Hannah go out to celebrate after the show and end up watching Nadine perform. Nadine is mad with jealousy when the audience gives Don and Hannah a round of applause as they come in. Nadine is the star dancer in ""The Girl On The Magazine Cover."" The song features an ingenious stage act, in which women appear against backdrops that look like the covers of contemporary magazines. Nadine herself appears on the cover of Harper\'s Bazaar. Afterwards, she insists that Don perform one of their old numbers with her for old times\' sake, as she tries to win Don back - ""It Only Happens When I Dance With You ."" When Don reluctantly agrees, Hannah becomes upset and runs out. She ends up at the bar where she and Don first met. There she pours out her troubles to Mike the bartender . Later, when Hannah returns to her apartment, she finds Don waiting for her. Don tries to explain that he was forced to dance with Nadine, but Hannah thinks Don used her to make Nadine jealous and win her back. Don tells Hannah he\'ll wait all night for her to forgive him, but just before Hannah opens the door, Don is kicked out of her building by the house detective. The next morning Hannah is telling Johnny about her and Don\'s misunderstanding. Johnny says if he loved someone he would let her know it, implying that Hannah should forget the argument and be with Don. Hannah realizes that Johnny is right and goes to meet Don for their date for the Easter Parade. Meanwhile, Don has been receiving various gifts at his apartment that morning, such as a rabbit and a new top hat, unaware that they\'re from Hannah. She arrives unexpectedly at his house, as if the argument never happened. Don is a little confused by this turn of events, but decides to go out with Hannah anyway. As they walk in the Easter parade, photographers, echoing a scene with Nadine from the beginning of the film, take their pictures and Don proposes to Hannah ([[Easter Parade .']"

We are then introduced to Henry , who is going about his business. Interspersed with this are shots of other murder victims. None of the actual murders are shown, but accompanying the shots of the bodies are the sounds of screaming and struggle. We are next introduced to Becky , waiting in an airport. She is met by her brother Otis , who met and befriended Henry in prison. Having split from her husband, Leroy, Becky has come to Chicago to make some money for herself and her daughter, who is living with Becky and Otis’ mother for the time being. Otis brings Becky back to the apartment he shares with Henry. Later that night, as Henry and Becky play cards, Becky asks Henry about the murder of his mother, the crime that landed him in prison. He tells her he stabbed his mother  because she abused and humiliated him as a child. Becky, for her part, reveals that her father molested her when she was a teenager. The next day, Becky gets a job in a hair salon. That evening, Henry kills two prostitutes with Otis witnessing. It becomes clear that Otis, although shocked, feels no remorse. He does, however, worry that the police might catch them. Henry assures him that everything will work out. Back at the apartment, Henry points out that if you\'ve killed once, any time you kill again, it always feels the same, and he explains his philosophy that the world they live in it is “them or us.” Henry and Otis go on a series of killings across Chicago together, killing a fence  and stealing a video camera and a top-of-the-line television in the process. The duo later on kill a random victim in Lower Wacker Drive, where Otis shoots a man who is tricked into pulling over. Henry begins to teach Otis more about being a serial killer. He explains that every murder should have a different modus operandi so the police won’t connect the different murders to one killer. He also explains that it’s important never to stay in the same place for too long; that way, by the time police know they’re looking for a serial killer, they can be long gone. Henry also tells Otis that he will have to leave Chicago soon, feeling the police will eventually be able to track him down. Henry and Otis then slaughter an entire family, recording the whole incident on their newly acquired video camera, and then watch it at their apartment for entertainment. Soon thereafter, Becky quits her job so she can return home to her daughter. Meanwhile, Otis and Henry get into an argument after their camera gets destroyed while driving. Otis gets out of the car and goes for a drink, while Henry returns to the apartment. Becky tells Henry her plans, and they decide to go out for a steak dinner. Later at home, she tries to seduce him, but he is unreceptive to her advances. A drunk Otis enters and asks if he\'s interrupting anything. Embarrassed, Henry leaves to buy cigarettes. He returns to find Otis strangling Becky after raping her. Henry kicks Otis off her and a fight ensues. Otis gets the upper hand and smashes a beer bottle onto Henry\'s face. Otis is about to kill Henry when Becky stabs Otis in the eye with the handle of a metal comb. Henry stabs Otis to death and dismembers his body in the bathtub, telling Becky that calling the police would be a mistake, and that they need to deal with the situation themselves. After packing, they dump Otis\' body parts in a river and leave town. Henry suggests that they go to his sister\'s ranch in San Bernardino, California, promising Becky they will send for her daughter when they arrive. In the car, Becky confesses that she loves Henry. ""I guess I love you too,"" Henry replies, unemotionally. They book into a motel for the night. The next morning, Henry leaves the motel alone, gets into the car and drives away. He stops at the side of the road to dump a suitcase in a ditch before driving off again. Blood stains are shown on the suitcase, implying that Becky was killed by Henry and that her body parts were placed into the suitcase. The final shot, shows the camera zooming in, on the suitcase, which is bloodstained, and then the scene fades to black and the credits roll.', 'Jamie Ashen  and his wife Lisa  receive a mysterious ventriloquist doll in the mail, ""Billy"",  in an unmarked package. Jamie and Lisa wonder who would have sent the doll. Lisa then remembers a poem she knew when she was younger, about a woman named Mary Shaw. Jamie disregards this and leaves to get dinner; he returns to discover Lisa is dead with her tongue ripped out, and Billy lying on the floor near her body. Detective Jim Lipton  suspects Jamie of the murder, but there is no evidence against him. Jamie discovers that Billy belonged to Mary Shaw , a ventriloquist from his hometown of Ravens Fair. Returning to the town for Lisa\'s funeral, he first confronts his wealthy, estranged father about Mary Shaw. Jamie\'s father is wheelchair-bound with a new wife, Ella , who takes care of him. His father and Ella remind him of the children\'s poem, regarding Shaw and her penchant for cutting out her victims\' tongues. Jamie leaves his father\'s home, warning Ella that his father is a monster. After Lisa\'s funeral, Jamie wanders into an old cemetery, where he finds Shaw\'s grave and those of her puppets. Marion , the mortician\'s senile wife, warns him of the danger of Shaw\'s puppets, and he realizes he should rebury Billy. He does so, only to find the puppet in his room later, accompanied by Lipton — who dug the puppet back up in the belief that it is evidence that Jamie is trying to conceal —, still not convinced of Jamie\'s innocence. Jamie tells him about the poem, but Lipton is skeptical. The next morning, Jamie steals Billy from the detective, and brings him to the mortician, Henry, who finally tells him about Mary Shaw. Shaw was a famous ventriloquist whose ambition was to make the perfect puppet. One night, at a performance attended by Henry, a young boy named Michael ([[Steven Taylor  heckled her, claiming that he could see Mary\'s lips moving. Mary quickly rebuffed this by presenting herself and Billy talking at the same time, and impressed the entire audience while also telling the boy, ""Now, who\'s the dummy?."" Michael went missing shortly after. While his body was never found, Shaw was blamed, and the village murdered her by cutting her tongue out. Her final wish was to turn her body into a ventriloquist\'s puppet and to be buried with her 101 puppets. Henry, at a very young age, wandered into his fathers mortuary and accidentally knocked the coffin over. Shaw\'s body came to life and she began approaching Henry. He survived because he covered his mouth to keep from screaming; Mary can only kill her victims when they scream. Henry\'s father then burst into the room, and discovered Henry cowering in the corner and Shaw\'s body on the floor. [[File:BillyDeadSilence.JPG|300px|thumb|left|Jamie and Detective Lipton exploring Mary Shaw\'s dressing room. Billy (from Saw  can be seen at the right corner Jamie investigates the theater and finds Shaw\'s dressing room. He discovers an old book with plans to make the perfect puppet. Jamie confronts his father and learns that the missing boy was his great-uncle. His father tells him that the boy\'s family, who was rich and respected by the entire community, murdered Shaw by forcing her to scream and then cut out her tongue. Other people of the village helped them in doing the task. The men involved were then killed off one by one, found with their tongues ripped out. Their wives, children, and children\'s children all suffered the same fate; Jamie\'s father deliberately drove Jamie away to try and spare him from that fate. His father then tells him Shaw will come back for them. Lipton tells Jamie that he exhumed Shaw\'s puppets\' graves and that all of them are missing. Jamie then receives a phone call from Henry, telling him to go to the theater, when in truth Henry had just been murdered by Mary Shaw; when she takes her victims\' tongues, she acquires their voices. With the detective following close behind, Jamie returns to the theater and Shaw\'s living quarters. Discovering a hidden back room, they find the body of Michael Ashen, murdered by Mary Shaw, strung up like a marionette, and 100 of Shaw\'s puppets. Michael was kidnapped by Mary Shaw and treated him as her twisted version of a beloved son after his corpse was turned into a puppet, symbolizing that Mary Shaw always wanted to have children but was unable to do so, thus using dummies to compensate with her frustration. Suddenly, one of the dolls begins talking to them. The doll, possessed by Shaw, tells them she wants to silence those who silenced her, and that she killed Lisa because she was pregnant. Shaw herself appears behind the doll, but Lipton shoots the doll and she disappears. She then begins materializing via the other dolls. Realizing that destroying all the dolls is Shaw\'s weakness, they set the room on fire and run from the theater with Shaw\'s ghost chasing them. When the catwalk in which they are running collapses, Shaw kills Lipton in mid-fall after he screams. Jamie escapes as the theater burns down, destroying all of Shaw\'s dolls, putting an end to her reign of terror. Jamie realizes that Billy is the only remaining puppet, and that the only way to get rid of Shaw is to destroy him. He goes to Henry, with who he had left Billy, only to discover that he is dead with his tongue ripped out. After Marion tells Jamie that his father took the doll, he returns to his father\'s house to destroy Billy. When he arrives, Mary Shaw reappears, but is forced to retreat when Jamie throws Billy into the fireplace. Jamie finds his father in his wheelchair, staring blankly. As he approaches him, Jamie is horrified as he discovers his father is dead, with his entire back hollowed out and replaced with a wooden shaft used in ventriloquist dummies. Jamie realizes his father had been wearing the same suit, and Ella had been at his side the entire time with her hand behind his back. As Mary Shaw\'s ""perfect doll"", Ella appears to Jamie, asking ""Now who\'s the dummy?"" Jamie screams and Mary Shaw materializes through Ella. Jamie becomes a doll, shown in Mary Shaw\'s photo album. In an alternate ending, Ella had been abused by Jamie\'s father until she suffered a miscarriage; she sought revenge, digging up one of Mary Shaw\'s puppets and was instantly possessed by Mary Shaw\'s ghost . Possessed by Shaw\'s spirit, Ella becomes the perfect puppet that Shaw strove to make. After killing Jamie\'s father, she hollowed out his corpse and used Jamie\'s father\'s corpse as a puppet to lure him back to Ravens Fair. Ella sits a tied up Jamie alongside his father and Lisa in a macabre family portrait. Jamie screams as Mary Shaw attacks him, presumably taking his tongue. The film ends with Ella reciting the poem to Jamie\'s corpse, tucked into bed like a child. Before blowing out the candle, Ella tells Jamie that if he sees Mary Shaw, the only thing that will protect him is silence.{{cite journal}}', 'On April 6, 2001, Anne Sluti , an all-American 17-year-old teenager, is seen running track at her high school as her boyfriend, Gary, and her best friend, Paige, watch. Gary gives Anne a teddy bear for their anniversary. Anne then departs with her best friend, but before she does so, she promises Gary that she\'ll pick up his CD at the mall. At home, Anne is surprised to see that her older brother, Tom , is on leave from the military. Anne\'s mother, Elaine , presents Anne with her acceptance letter from college. Anne is excited and says she wants to tell Gary and Paige; her dad  gives her money to pick up the CD. Anne is next seen exiting the mall. Suddenly, when she is about to get into her car, Tony Zappa  comes up behind her and drags her to his car. Anne begins screaming as onlookers call 911; Anne finds her way out of the car as Tony punches her in the stomach, throws Anne in the car, and drives off. The police arrive. When one of the detectives tells Officer Mike Timbrook  that the car belongs to Anne Sluti, Officer Timbrook realizes that he knows her family and goes off to tell the Sluti family of Anne\'s kidnapping. Anne awakens at night as Tony tells her that she shouldn\'t have screamed. Anne said she screamed because he was punching her, and soon realizes that Tony won\'t allow her to be released. Tony pulls the car over, and after binding her hands behind her with duct tape and blindfolding her, he tells her that if she can get herself out of the tape, he\'ll let her leave. She is unable to do so, and Tony returns her to the car. While driving for some time, he removes the blindfold. The car suddenly crashes and flips on its side. Tony frees himself, but Anne, strapped in a seat belt with her hands still bound, is unable to do the same. Tony climbs back and cuts the seat belt, pulls her out of the car, and onto the grass. While she gasps for air, Tony says, ""I saved your life. That means I own you."" Daylight breaks and Tony has a chain around Anne\'s neck as they walk down a dirt road. Tony sees a tractor and ties the end of the chain to a post while he drags the car out of the ditch with the tractor. Anne uses this opportunity to leave a message by carving her name into a rock. Anne persuades Tony to let her call someone and tell them that it was her idea to take off. Back at the Sluti home, one of Anne\'s mother\'s friends, Cat, lets Anne\'s parents stay at her home to rest while she stays at their house in case anything new happens. Later, the phone rings, and it\'s Anne. Tony has her call home in a phone booth. Anne asks for her mother Elaine, pretending that Elaine is just a friend, but Tony hangs up and has her call Paige. Anne leaves a clue in her message. Tony believes she says she\'s on ""a quality vacation,"" while she is actually saying ""equality vacation,"" signifying that she is in Wyoming . Then she hangs up, and Tony says that it\'s time they start their ""vacation."" Tony and Anne stop at a cabin that he breaks into. He cooks them dinner made from a rabbit he killed; this is when Anne learns his name and that he is going to keep her. In a delusion, he states he imagines Anne in a yellow dress, thanking him for a nice dinner. He then takes the chain lock that was previously on Anne\'s neck, attaching it to her leg and a couch. He then gives her a wedding ring to wear. He excuses himself to ""take a piss,"" while in reality he is injecting himself with drugs and begins yelling upstairs. Anne then spots a phone outlet, which she drags closer to herself by using an umbrella. She dials 9-1-1 and tells the operator that she\'s been kidnapped by a man named Tony. The call is being traced; Officer Timbrook received word about the call. He and FBI Agent Reynolds , who have taken over the case due to Anne being taken across state lines, learn that Tony Zappa is the abductor and that he is wanted on other charges for causing a manhunt after closing down the Mall of America in search of him the month before. As the FBI search the cabin, they discover that Anne and Tony have fled. Officer Timbrook and Agent Reynolds go to visit Tony\'s grandmother for questioning; she is a religious woman who says that Tony is a good boy. Anne\'s mother is at home praying. Tony, angered at Anne for alerting the police, has her starting to dig her own grave. She argues that he\'s going to kill her anyway and refuses to dig anymore, pleading with Tony either to let her go or shoot her. He holds a knife up to her and lets her know that he is not going to kill her. He then pushes her to the ground; she realizes what he\'s going to do and begs him to stop, but he puts the knife up to her, cuts her bra open, and rapes her. The next morning, Tony takes her to a campsite, where he tells Anne to wash herself to destroy evidence, whilst he searches a camp truck and house for new clothes for her. Anne pulls from her jacket the teddy bear that Gary gave her. Anne washes her face and arms vigorously while Tony watches from afar. He then goes outside and gives Anne sweatpants, a sweatshirt, and slippers to change into inside the house. After she changes, Tony tells her that she looks nice. When Tony goes outside, Anne turns on the television and sees a news report on her and Tony, then an interview with her parents and brother. She begins to cry as Tony rushes inside. She quickly turns off the television, but he knows that it had been on. He asks her what it was, and she denies that she had been doing anything. Tony is amused when the reporter gives a description of him, calling him the ""jack rabbit,"" but he gets enraged when a description of the car is listed; he knocks the television off of its shelf as it breaks. Tony storms out of the house as Anne follows. He turns around as she says they need to find a new car. Tony tells her to come so they can go. Anne asks why he took her. He responds saying ""I get tired of being alone"". Tony steals a station wagon and makes Anne get all of the stuff out of the other car. She leaves her teddy bear behind as another clue. Officer Timbrook and Agent Reynolds find the car not too long after. Officer Timbrook finds the teddy bear and removes its head, finding a note that says ""Sluti Wed 1 PM."" He shows Officer Reynolds the note, telling her that they missed the two by an hour. Tony discovers another deserted house. As he breaks the bolt off the door, an older man walking his dog spots the station wagon and looks right at the house. While Anne and Tony are inside, he starts yelling at no one, coming right out and asking her if she hears ""that."" She says that she doesn\'t hear anything. Tony drags her close to the window and asks her what she sees; she says she can\'t see anything because it\'s too dark, as it is nighttime. Lights flash outside as it becomes evident that the FBI and police have found them. Tony becomes hysterical, blaming Anne and saying he is not going to go to prison. Anne tells him to call the police, as she won\'t let them hurt him. She gets on the phone and asks them to let Tony call his grandmother. When he talks to his grandmother she asks if it\'s true that he took Anne, and said she\'ll be praying for him. Tony tells his grandmother that he\'s going to kill Anne, and then himself. He points the gun at Anne\'s chest as Anne picks up the phone and tells the police not to shoot, as they are coming out. She tells Tony they can\'t shoot, or they\'d end up shooting her, too. As they exit the house, he has his arm wrapped around her; she turns around and tells him to put the gun down. As he does, Anne runs to Officer Timbrook. Tony begins screaming for Anne as the FBI and police rush towards him. He begs them not to shoot, as he is getting on the ground. While Officer Timbrook is hugging Anne, he shows her the teddy bear that she left behind, returning it to Anne. Tony is put in the back of a police car, still screaming her name. Anne and Officer Timbrook walk up to the window as Anne throws at the window the wedding ring Tony gave to her. The film ends with Anne in a car as Officer Timbrook drives her home. She gets out of the car, running towards her family and hugging them as reporters all around are filming and asking questions. Officer Timbrook smiles while Anne\'s father looks up at him, mouthing, ""Thank you.""']"

Guttuart goes to Gergovia, the capital of the Arvenes tribe, to attend a meeting of Gallic tribal chieftains. The young boy Vercingetorix, along with his friend the young girl Eponia, sneak into a large cavern where Celtill, Vercingetorix's father and chieftain of the Arvenes, hosts the meeting of chieftains with the intention of proclaiming himself king of all Gauls. When Celtill shows off the crown once worn by the old kings of Gaul, an arrow from two Roman spies  hits Celtill in the back. Gobanittio, Celtill's brother, places Celtill under arrest while the Roman spies flee with the crown. Vercingetorix tries to rush in to help his father, but Guttuart prevents the young boy from intervening and explains that destiny requires Celtill to meet his fate. The young Vercingetorix, while watching his uncle burn his father alive, swears revenge. Many years later, the grown up Vercingetorix , having been educated among the druids, continues to seek revenge against his uncle. He and Guttuart go to a road being built by the Romans, but Guttuart flees upon seeing the approach of Julius Caesar  and an entourage of Roman legionaries. Caesar, who held the position of proconsul of Transalpine Gaul, invites Vercingetorix and the Arvenes to participate in an invasion of Britain and gives Vercingetorix a horse to ride back to Gergovia. Upon his arrival at Gergovia, Vercingetorix first avenges his father's death by killing his uncle and then tells his tribe of Caesar's offer to give one half of the booty if the tribe joins in the expedition to Britain. At Bibracte, capital of the Eduens tribe, various chieftains gather to hear Caesar speak of his planned invasion of Britain. Dumnorix, chieftain of the Eduens,  is skeptical of the Romans and tells Caesar that he does not want to go, but Caesar takes his children as hostages anyway. Later, Vercingetorix is reunited with his childhood friend Eponia  in a private meeting with Caesar, who shows to Vercingetorix and Eponia the old crown of the kings of Gaul. Caesar suggests that the numerous Gallic tribes should be united under one king chosen by Rome, but Vercingetorix refuses Caesar's offer by saying that the king of the Gauls should be chosen by destiny. After Dumnorix attacks a Roman garrison, Caesar orders Vercingetorix to capture him. When Vercingetorix confronts Dumnorix, the latter tells him that it was the Romans who orchestrated Celtill’s death. Two Roman officers have been following Vercingetorix, and one of them kills Dumnorix instantly with a sling stone to the forehead. Vercingetorix kills the Roman who slew Dumnorix and sends the other one back to Caesar, who learns that he has made an enemy with someone whom he would rather have as an ally. Vercingetorix, after being elected as leader of the Arvernes at Gergovia, uses scorched earth tactics against the Romans, but he reluctantly spares the city of Avaricum from the torch. Caesar orders the massacre of Avaricum’s inhabitants and leads his army to Gergovia to attack Vercingetorix and the Arvernes. The Eduens also arrive at Gergovia, but they abruptly end their alliance with Rome because of Caesar's massacre of Avaricum. A terribly disappointed Caesar curses all the Gauls and his army is forced to retreat. While the Gallic chieftains elect Vercingetorix as commander-in-chief of a united Gallic army, Caesar forms a pact with the fearsome Teutons at the Rhine River. The Teutons ambush two of the Arvernes and the presence of the Teutons concerns Vercingetorix. Vercingetorix goes to Alesia but Caesar also arrives there with a large army to besiege the city. During this Battle of Alesia, the Romans quickly build a circle of fortifications around the city and this forces Vercingetorix to wait inside the city for a Gallic relief army to arrive. Problems in the election of a commander for this relief army delays its arrival at Gergovia. When the relief army finally arrives, Vercingetorix orders that the Gauls simply surround the Romans, who are now trapped in their own fortifications, and not attack them. Caesar is aware that his army will starve to death if the Gauls do not attack, but he is confident that destiny will play its part. The Gauls clamour for one big battle and Vercingetorix reluctantly agrees to lead them in the fight. Gallic warriors rush towards the Roman fortifications, but the Romans shoot them down with volleys of arrows and javelins. When Caesar unleashes the Teutons into battle, all was lost for the Gauls and they withdraw amidst the large field of dead bodies. Vercingetorix resigns in the fate of the conquered Gauls and rides out to give himself up to the Romans at their fort, where he lays down his weapons and kneels before Caesar. The film ends with Guttuart’s narration that Caesar was assassinated on the Ides of March 44 B.C. on the steps of the Roman Senate and that Vercingetorix, imprisoned in Rome, was executed two years earlier by order of Caesar."", 'George , a knight returned from the Crusades, wishes to retire from soldiering, find a wife, and settle on ""an acre of land with two head of cattle."" To conclude the transaction, he agrees to help the land\'s owner, King Edgaar , whose daughter Princess Lunna  has disappeared. Also in search of the princess are Garth , betrothed of the unwilling princess, and the mercenary El Cabillo, a title which passes through different men, and begins with  Val Kilmer. The princess has been kidnapped by a female dragon, which lays an egg and then seemingly dies a few days later. Rather than escaping, the princess decides to guard the egg, which she believes holds the last dragon on earth, whom she has named Smite. George\'s father Sir Robert ([[Paul Freeman , a previous friend of King Edgaar\'s and an amputee from his own previous run-in with the mother dragon, gives his son George a Dragon Horn, which ""sounds a note only a dragon can hear"". When George encounters the princess, he attempts to destroy the egg but she knocks him unconscious each time he tries. They then, in company with other companions, transport the egg by wagon back to her father. Along the way they stop at a convent, where Lunna\'s cousin is a nun, and a friar is an old friend of George\'s. The princess\'s betrothed, Garth, catches up with them at the convent, and she says she will not marry him because she does not love him. He then kidnaps her to force her to marry him, as it is part of his plan to take over the kingdom. Mercenaries arrive, led by the El Cabillo, who then reveals himself to the group as Tarik , a Moor who was a close friend of George\'s seen at the beginning of the film before the two part ways. But El Cabillo\'s men revolt against him, as they wish to capture the Princess and claim the reward. While they are all fighting, the baby dragon hatches, the monk Elmendorf is killed saving the Princess from a flying spear, and King Edgaar\'s men and Sir Robert\'s men arrive to join the fray. During this fight, Garth and George are fighting, but turn to find themselves facing a mutual enemy: the former second-in-command of El Cabillo, the leader of the mutiny. They fight him off together, while taking shots at each other. This conflagration is interrupted as the wall of the castle keep explodes across the screen. The mother dragon has returned. The combatants all flee. George is last to the door of the keep but debris prevents his escape. In the castle courtyard the former combatants all listen in silence as the dragon makes much noise within the keep. The Princess Lunna fears the worst for both George and the dragon she has named herself. Within the keep the mother dragon seems preoccupied with her child and George is largely frozen lest he attract the mother dragon\'s attention. George notices a lance protrudes from the mother dragons side. This is the lance of his father still lodged in the beast. George slowly approaches the lance and takes hold. He asks God\'s forgiveness for what he must do and promises to make this as painless as possible for the dragon. The scene shifts to the castle courtyard a roar is heard. George emerges from the keep with a bloodied lance. Believing that George has slain the dragon the men are overjoyed. The Princess Lunna however is not and, overcome with sorrow for both the dragon\'s death and George\'s betrayal, flees on horseback. George pursues with King Edgaar\'s horse and his blessing to marry his daughter. There is a chase along the shore of a large body of water but George is not alone in the chase. Garth has also pursued. Garth knocks George from his steed and they fight. Garth has the advantage and as he raises his sword for the killing blow the mother dragon leaps from the water and swallows Garth whole. The Princess Lunna realizes that George did not actually kill the dragons. They kiss and presumably live happily ever after.', ""3 years on since first meeting the Railway Dragon, Emily manages to summon him to her house one night by shouting tidings. Upon his arrival, Emily reveals to him that she would like him to come to her birthday party and meet her other friends. The dragon, however, is reluctant as he feels that the world is not yet safe for him, despite Emily telling him there are lots of people like her who can make the world safe for dragons. Furthermore, the dragon is curious as to what a birthday is. Emily shows him through a projector after going through different slides, including a picture of the forest and the zoo, before finding a pic from one of her earlier birthday parties and explaining to the dragon that a birthday is a celebration of the day you were born . Furthermore, Emily tells him about the best part of birthdays, which is receiving presents, before showing him by making him a present , and giving it to him to unwrap, much to his delight. When Emily tells him if he comes it will be the best present she could ask for, as well as assuring him that he'll be safe, the Dragon happily agrees to come to her party before flying off into the night. The next morning, the boss of a circus informs two bumbling clowns, Lenny and Clarence, that they have another birthday party to do. Clarence is an overweight man who enjoys clowning, but is quite dumb and easily sidetracked. Lenny, on the other hand, hates it and is constantly infuriated by Clarence while looking for a way to get a better job. At Emily's party, Emily has made everyone dress up as dragons to help the Railway Dragon blend in, which is successful. Lenny and Clarence perform to the children but both mess up, so Emily, the dragon and the children move onto the games. It all goes well, until a blindfolded child playing 'Pin the tail on the donkey' accidentally stabs the dragon in the butt, causing him to fly up and roar, scaring the children away in the process. Angry, the Dragon tells Emily is was a mistake coming to her party and flies off back to his Railway tunnel, despite Emily calling for him to come back. This is watched by both Lenny and Clarence, with both realising the dragon is real and Lenny now believing they have a way to 'get to the top'. The two clowns follow Emily to try and find the Dragon's lair, unbeknown to her. However, they lose track of her when she slides down the burrow into the Railway Dragon's lair. Although she cannot find the dragon, she tells him that just because things went bad at the party doesn't mean they can't still be friends, and states that she 'doesn't want a world without dragons' before leaving the cave. In the forest, the other dragons she met on the Day of Tidings appear to her to try and cheer her up, but she sends them away and tells them that they must hide where humans aren't looking. In his cave, the Railway dragon tearfully looks back on the days events before finding the Noah's Ark clock he received from Emily. Upset at how he has hurt Emily's feelings , he comes up with a plan to make it up to her by giving her the best present ever. That night, Emily is woken up and finds various zoo animals in her house and garden before seeing the Dragon outside and hugging him. The dragon reveals he has brought almost all the animals from the zoo  as her birthday present. Emily tells him it is a wonderful present, but it's not safe in the world right now for the animals. The dragon and Emily both agree that they must work till they make it safe again for both the zoo animals and for dragons. They are interrupted, however, by Lenny and Clarence . As the Dragon roars and advances towards them, the two clowns spring their trap and catch the Railway Dragon in a net attached to a circus pickup truck. As they drive off, Emily shouts tidings to call the other dragons. Together, they quickly capture both Lenny and Clarence  before freeing the Railway Dragon. While the other dragons 'play' with the two clowns, Emily and the Railway Dragon manage to return all the animals back to the Zoo before the Zoo owner realises they're missing. At the Circus, the Boss takes several days wages from Lenny and Clarence for various reasons including their 'stupid story' about the Dragons. As Lenny is about to complain to Clarence, the two look up fearfully as Emily and the Dragon fly overhead, with both clowns agreeing that they didn't see anything. In the sky, the railway dragon takes Emily for another fun ride before flying back to the railway tunnel with her. He is upset as he has not been able to give her a present to keep, but Emily reassures him that she has a wonderful present to keep; a memory of the day's events and also that she and the dragon are still friends. As the dragon happily states that the day feels like his birthday also, Emily surprises him as the other dragons appear  and wish him happy birthday, before both himself and Emily blow out the candles on the cake together.""]"

It's called “Motel Hello,” but the neon ‘O’ flickers. Vincent smokes meats said to be the most delicious in the area. The secret is human flesh, and Vincent has the areas around his motel strewn with various booby traps to catch victims. The victims are restrained, then placed in a 'secret garden,’ buried up to their necks, and have their vocal chords cut to prevent them from screaming. They are kept in the ground and fed until they are ready for harvest. Ida helps Vincent, who feels he does no wrong and sees the victims as animals. Vincent shoots out the tires of a couple on a motorcycle. The male, Bo, is placed in the garden, but Vincent brings the female, Terry, to the motel. The next morning, Vincent and Ida's naïve brother, Sheriff Bruce, arrives. Vincent tells Terry her boyfriend died in the accident and was buried: a trip to the graveyard shows his crude grave marker. Terry, having nowhere else to go, decides to stay at the motel. Vincent and Ida subsequently capture more victims for the garden while Vincent uses his folksy charm to woo Terry, much to Bruce's dislike, who tries to woo her himself without much success. Vincent captures more victims by placing a pack of cardboard cow roadblocks to entice victims, and luring in a pair of swingers who have read a fake ad and believe the hotel to be a swing joint. The next day, he suggests he teach Terry to smoke meat. Ida becomes jealous and attempts to drown Terry, but Vincent arrives to save her. This is catalyst for Terry, who tries to seduce Vincent. He agrees to marry her the next day. Bruce drives down to the motel to protest Terry's choice. He tells Terry Vincent has 'syphilis of the brain,’ perhaps providing a reason for his behavior, before Vincent appears and chases his brother with a shotgun. To prepare for the wedding, Vincent, Terry, and Ida drink champagne, but Ida drugs it so Terry passes out. Ida and Vincent then prepare some victims for the wedding. Meanwhile, Bruce does detective work and becomes suspicious of his brother. Vincent and Ida kill three victims and take them to Vincent's meat processing plant. Doing so loosens the dirt around Bo, and he begins to escape. Bruce sneaks back to the motel to rescue Terry, but Ida returns and ambushes Bruce when he leaves the room. She knocks him out, and then takes Terry at gunpoint to the meat processing plant. Meanwhile, Bo escapes and frees the other victims. Vincent sends Ida back to the motel to fetch his brother, but the victims knock her out. Terry tries to escape, but Vincent gasses her, and then ties her to a conveyor belt. He is interrupted by Bo, who crashes through a window, but Vincent strangles the weakened man. Bruce awakens, finds one of his brother's shotguns, and goes to the plant, but finds that his brother has armed himself with a giant chainsaw. Vincent disarms his brother, but Bruce grabs his own chainsaw and duels Vincent. During the fight, the belt Terry is tied to activates, sending her slowly towards a cutting blade. Despite suffering several wounds, Bruce drives the chainsaw deep into Vincent's side. Bruce frees Terry and then returns with her to his brother, who gasps his final words, leaving the farm and 'secret garden' to Bruce, and then lamenting that he was a hypocrite because he used preservatives. Bruce and Terry go to the ‘secret garden’ and find it empty, except for Ida, who is buried head first. They head past the motel, while Bruce comments how he was glad he left home when he was eleven. Terry suggests burning the motel, claiming it is evil. The sign saying “Motel Hello” finally fully shorts out, permanently darkening the ‘O’."", ""In the beginning of the film, Johnny Hitchcock  is driving back to his fictional home town of Grayson East in England having just been visiting his ill cousin in Liverpool.

The majority of humanity resides in huge Mega-Cities, where the traditional justice system has been replaced by a corps of Judges whose role combines those of police officer, judge, jury, and executioner. The most dedicated ""Street Judge"" in Mega-City One is Joseph Dredd , who assists Judge Hershey  in ending a block war. Herman Ferguson , a hacker recently released from prison, is caught in the firefight and hides inside a food dispensing robot, only to be arrested by Dredd and sentenced to five years\' imprisonment for tampering with city property. Rico , a former Judge turned psychopathic murderer, escapes from prison and reclaims his Judge\'s uniform and ""Lawgiver"" gun as well as a decommissioned combat robot. A news reporter  critical of Dredd is soon murdered, and Dredd is the chief suspect. Hershey acts as Dredd\'s defense lawyer in a trial before a tribunal of Council Judges including Dredd\'s mentor Chief Judge Fargo  and Judge Griffin . Dredd is found guilty based on DNA evidence: The Lawgiver encodes the DNA of the wielder onto each round fired, and the DNA from the murder weapon matches Dredd\'s. Fargo steps down as Chief Judge, asking as his last request that the Council spare Dredd\'s life. Dredd is sentenced to life imprisonment while Fargo embarks on his ""long walk"", a tradition in which a retiring Judge ventures into the ""Cursed Earth"" wasteland ""to bring law to the lawless"". Griffin, who freed Rico and had him frame Dredd for the murder, succeeds Fargo as Chief Judge and instructs Rico to sow chaos throughout the city. Dredd finds himself seated next to Herman Ferguson on a transport ship to the Aspen penal colony. While passing over the Cursed Earth the ship is shot down by the Angel Gang, a family of cannibalistic scavengers who capture Dredd and Herman. A squad of Judges tracks Dredd to the Angels\' camp and a battle ensues. Fargo arrives just in time to save Dredd\'s life, but is mortally wounded by Mean Machine Angel . Before dying, Fargo reveals the secrets of Dredd\'s past: Dredd is the result of the Janus project, an experiment in genetic engineering intended to create the perfect Judge. DNA from the Council Judges was combined to create two clones, Dredd and Rico. Both were given artificial memories of childhood, and they became close friends. However, while Dredd became the ideal Judge that the Council hoped for, Rico\'s personality twisted and he instead became the perfect criminal. Dredd was forced to judge Rico for murdering civilians, but instead of being executed Rico was sent to Aspen by Griffin. Since he and Rico share the same DNA, Dredd deduces that Rico framed him for the reporter\'s murder. Fargo concludes that Griffin is trying to reactivate the Janus project, and begs Dredd to stop him. Back in Mega-City One, Rico creates panic by assassinating 108 Judges in two days. Griffin uses this to convince the Council Judges to unlock the Janus files, but when they refuse to reactivate the program he has Rico kill them. Arriving immediately after this, Dredd and Herman are accused by Griffin of murdering the Council. They evade the Judges and seek help from Hershey, who has been investigating Dredd\'s past. Dredd tells her about the Janus project, and the trio head to the Janus laboratory at the Statue of Liberty. Rico betrays Griffin, having the robot kill him, and replaces the DNA for the Janus clones with his own. Herman uses his hacking skills to save Dredd and Hershey from the robot. Rico orders his clones activated prematurely, but they are incomplete and unable to stop Dredd. Dredd pursues Rico to the top of the statue, and after a final struggle sends Rico falling to his death.

As Fuentes digs into the jungle in search of his students, he discovers that ""men with guns have reached them first, his students being menaced by many men with guns  .

As he eats at a diner, Inspector Ho Sheung-Sang , a police negotiator, has been called to the scene of a bank robbery standoff that\'s being bungled by his inept boss, Wong Kai-Fat . Listening to a negotiation between Wong and the robbers, Ho feels that the robbers are professionals and goes in the negotiate with the robbers, but finds them nervous and arguing with each other. After goading the robbers, a man amongst the hostages stands up and shoots the robbers dead. Claiming to be an off duty officer, Inspector Ho recognizes his sniffling as the robber talking to Wong before he went in. As the police rush in, Inspector Ho leaves the crime scene to grab some breakfast. In the crowd, an old man takes pictures of him. Cheung has taken an interest in Ho, who he discovers was a former member SDU. He then stages his own robbery to get in contact with him. He scares away the personnel of a finance company and takes the manager hostage, stuffing his jacket full of diamonds and money. Cheung is met with another negotiator and Wong, so he drags out the negotiation longer until Ho is called to the scene. When Ho finally appears, Cheung proposes to play a three-day long game. Cheung shoots the manager and Ho and the police give chase until Cheung stalls them enough to make an escape with a bomb, which turns out to be fake. The manager also reappears unharmed, having been shot with a paintball. In the confusion of trying to track down Cheung down, Cheung makes his escape by posing as SDU and a cop. Ho is the lone person giving chase, but meets with Cheung after posing as a taxi driver. Amazed at Ho\'s ploy, he\'ll admit defeat at the game if Ho can take him to the police station before three days are over. Cheung then pulls a gun a starts shooting out the window to test Ho\'s reaction. When Ho slams the brakes, Cheung flees and jumps aboard to mini-bus. When stopped at a police road block, Cheung avoids them by sitting next to a woman on the bus and pretending to be her boyfriend. Having seen his gun, she cooperates, letting him put his sunglasses on her and taking one of the earphones on her music player. Leaving the road block, he gets off. The woman gets off as well, giving Cheung his sunglasses back. Dealing with the aftermath of letting Cheung get away, Ho realizes that they haven\'t looked into the finance company that Cheung held up. Meanwhile, a man known only as Baldy  is having a diamond that he had stolen appraised by the old man who was taking pictures of Ho earlier. The two Americans who stole the diamond for him ask for more money. Baldy pulls out his gun and points it at the old man, who confirms it\'s authenticity. Baldy then kills the two Americans and takes the diamond. Ho returns to the finance company for further questioning, and sees Baldy entering the office space next door. He tries to get in, but it stopped by one of Baldy\'s men. As Cheung watches a video feed of the vault at Baldy\'s office, he puts a screw inside a box. As he takes a drink, he coughs out blood, meaning his condition is worsening with internal bleeding. Ho tries to reason why Cheung held up the finance company and not the jewelry or antique stores in the building and why Cheung chose him for his game. As he leaves for the day, Ho receives a Cheung\'s package. He meets up with his friend, the Head of Interpol, who\'s given him information on Baldy, who\'s wanted for possession of explosives, and one Peter Cheung, the old man who took pictures of him and appraised the diamond. Peter Cheung was Baldy\'s boss until Baldy kicked him out. More focused on the case, he skips having dinner with her to break into Baldy\'s office. When trying to get in, he\'s turned away by security, who\'s told by Wong that he\'s not on the case. Ho sneaks in anyway as Cheung watches him on video feeds. Using a packet of dairy creamer he took from security, Ho enters the finance company and finds the grate that Cheung\'s screw comes from. Going through the vents, he finds men that Baldy had to keep an eye on the diamond and Cheung\'s video equipment, which Cheung uses to give away Ho\'s entrance. Ho tries to escape, but Cheung calls him and leads him to an emergency door that turns out to be a dead end. Ho tries to pick the lock on the emergency door, which is opened by the guy who he encountered earlier when he tried to get into the office. Knowing that Baldy will come down to get the diamond out of there, Cheung reveals a car identical to Baldy\'s. Cheung takes the diamond, and Ho and Baldy\'s men give chase. As both Ho and Cheung get fired on by Baldy\'s men, the two are amazed at each other\'s resilience. They work together to get out of the predicament, but Ho realizes that now he\'s the one with a gun and Cheung is the one driving. Cheung reiterates that if Ho can get him to the police station, he wins. However, Cheung drives the car into a wall. After the collision, both men try to get the diamond. Cheung walks away with it, but not before dropping his painkilling pills. Wong, who thinks the pills are Ho\'s, tries to talk to him. Ho\'s Interpol friend comes and brings him more information on Peter Cheung, who died a year ago, and a photo of Cheung, his son. Cheung, who has been masquerading as his father, sends Baldy proof that he has the diamond and will give it back for $20 million HK. Ho meets with Cheung at the diner, asking why he\'s still playing with him even though he\'s got the diamond and has avenged his father. Ho gives him a minute to give him a good reason not to arrest him now. Cheung wants to have Ho arrest Baldy, but realizes that Ho isn\'t doing this for fame or a promotion. Cheung then taunts Ho, saying that he\'s beating Ho in their little game. Ho lets him leave so they can finish their game. Cheung takes a bus, where he meets the woman from earlier again. The bus is pulled over by the police, and the woman invites Cheung over like before. She takes him to a restaurant, but he leaves when he starts coughing up blood. Cheung has set the place to make the exchange for the diamond at a bowling alley, which is being staked out by Ho, Wong and the police. Ho bumps into the same henchman he\'s been running into, who still doesn\'t recognize him. Cheung has Ho make the exchange for him, but Baldy has Cheung, who\'s disguised as a woman, get the money. Ho tries to get Wong to check in on the money exchange, but Wong doesn\'t get the message. Cheung, who\'s taken out Baldy\'s man and the cop while getting the money, takes off his disguise and makes the exchange himself, telling Ho that the ""woman"" is conning him. Baldy takes Cheung\'s bag, which holds a bowling ball, and throws it on the floor in rage, revealing diamonds inside. The police move in and arrest Baldy for stealing the diamonds from the finance company next door. Cheung leaves the scene with the diamond and the money. Ho catches up with Cheung, finally arrests him and prepares to take him to the police station. Cheung reveals another ""bomb"" and pulls out another detonator like the one before. Ho calls him on his bluff and presses the detonator, which starts a timer on the bomb. Cheung, who knows he\'s going to die soon, wishes that he not die in a jail cell, so Ho stops and gets out of the car. The timer reaches zero, which starts up the car and Cheung escapes again. When Wong berates Ho for letting Cheung get away again, Ho simply ignores him and goes to grab something to eat. Cheung drives away, smiling. Ho reads in the newspaper that someone using his name donated $20 million HK to a children\'s cancer foundation. He hops on a bus and meets the woman Cheung kept running into wearing the diamond. Ho admires the diamond, though she brushes it off as something cheap. He asks who gave it to her, and she says she hasn\'t seen him in a while. Ho tells her to hold on to it.']"

Years later in Iraq, Hannibal is contacted by CIA Special Activities Division operative Lynch, who assigns them a black ops mission to recover U.S. Treasury plates and around over $1 billion in cash from Iraqi insurgents slated to move it out of Baghdad in an armored convoy. Hannibal\'s commanding officer, General Morrison, consents to the operation but Face\'s former lover, DCIS Capt. Charissa Sosa, tries to discourage the team against getting the plates. The mission is successful; when the team returns to base, however, the money and Morrison\'s vehicle are destroyed by Brock Pike and his men from the private security firm Black Forest. Without Morrison, the only proof that they were authorized to act, the team is sentenced to ten years in prison and is dishonorably discharged. Six months later, Lynch visits Hannibal in prison and tells him that Pike may be trying to sell the plates with the help of an Arab backer. Hannibal, who has been tracking Pike on his own, makes a deal with Lynch: full reinstatement and clean records for his team in return for the plates. Lynch agrees and Hannibal escapes, breaking out Face, BA, and Murdock in the process. Sosa, who was demoted to lieutenant for her role in the Iraq fiasco, is hot on the team\'s trail.

It is revealed that the backer is actually General Morrison, who plotted with Lynch and Pike to steal the plates but teamed up with Pike to double-cross Lynch and fake his death. Lynch orders an airstrike to kill the team, but Morrison dies instead. Hannibal arranges to meet Sosa on board a container ship at the Los Angeles docks, saying he will hand over Morrison and the plates. Face then calls Sosa on a drop phone he planted on her at the train station, and conspires a different plan with her.

Though capably leading his platoon earns him a Silver Star medal for valour, Gifford outwardly shows signs of fear, battle fatigue, and neurosis. These weaknesses intensify when his father-in-law is killed. When a frightened lieutenant machine guns his three friends out of panic and inexperience, Gifford attempts to beat him to death with his rifle butt. Gifford is subdued, reduced in rank to private, and imprisoned. Gifford is summoned by Lt. Colonel Miles . Because he had earned a Silver Star, he is given a choice of being sentenced to the United States Disciplinary Barracks in Leavenworth or transferred to George Company, a de facto punishment company assigned to a dangerous area of the front lines. Gifford chooses the punishment company, which is commanded by Captain Grimes, a former First Sergeant . Captain Grimes insists everyone call him ""Waco"", wears no rank insignia and forbids military salutes lest he become a target for snipers. Everyone in George Company hates Waco except for some pre-war regular army comrades-in-arms , who act as Waco\'s personal bodyguards.

The film opens with archival footage of police raiding gay bars and arresting patrons during the 1950s and 1960s, followed by Dianne Feinstein\'s November 27, 1978, announcement to the press that Milk and Moscone had been assassinated. Milk is seen recording his will throughout the film, nine days  before the assassinations. The film then flashes back to New York City in 1970, the eve of Milk\'s 40th birthday and his first meeting with his much younger lover, Scott Smith . Unsatisfied with his life and in need of a change, Milk and Smith decide to move to San Francisco in the hope of finding larger acceptance of their relationship. They open Castro Camera in the heart of Eureka Valley, a working-class neighborhood in the process of evolving into a predominantly gay neighborhood known as The Castro. Frustrated by the opposition they encounter in the once Irish-Catholic neighborhood, Milk utilizes his background as a businessman to become a gay activist, eventually becoming a mentor for Cleve Jones . Early on, Smith serves as Milk\'s campaign manager, but his frustration grows with Milk\'s devotion to politics, and he leaves him. Milk later meets Jack Lira , a sweet-natured but unbalanced young man. As with Smith, Lira cannot tolerate Milk\'s devotion to political activism, and eventually hangs himself. Milk clashes with the local gay ""establishment"" which he feels to be too cautious and risk-averse. After two unsuccessful political campaigns in 1973 and 1975 to become a city supervisor and a third in 1976 for the California State Assembly, Milk finally wins a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1977 for District 5. His victory makes him the first openly gay man to be voted into major public office in California and in the top three in the entire US. Milk subsequently meets fellow Supervisor Dan White , a Vietnam veteran and former police officer and firefighter. White, who is politically and socially conservative, has a difficult relationship with Milk, and develops a growing resentment for Milk when he opposes projects that White proposes. Milk and White forge a complex working relationship. Milk is invited to, and attends, the christening of White\'s first child, and White asks for Milk\'s assistance in preventing a psychiatric hospital from opening in White\'s district, possibly in exchange for White\'s support of Milk\'s citywide gay rights ordinance. When Milk fails to support White because of the negative effect it will have on troubled youth, White feels betrayed, and ultimately becomes the sole vote against the gay rights ordinance. Milk also launches an effort to defeat Proposition 6, an initiative on the California state ballot in November 1978. Sponsored by John Briggs , a conservative state legislator from Orange County, Proposition 6 seeks to ban gays and lesbians  from working in California\'s public schools. It is also part of a nationwide conservative movement that starts with the successful campaign headed by Anita Bryant and her organization Save Our Children in Dade County, Florida to repeal a local gay rights ordinance. On November 7, 1978, after working tirelessly against Proposition 6, Milk and his supporters rejoice in the wake of its defeat. The increasingly unstable White favors a supervisor pay raise, but does not get much support, and shortly after supporting the proposition, resigns from the Board. He later changes his mind and asks to be reinstated. Mayor Moscone  denies his request, after being lobbied by Milk. On the morning of November 27, 1978, White enters City Hall through a basement window to conceal a gun from metal detectors. He requests another meeting with Moscone, who rebuffs his request for appointment to his former seat. Enraged, White shoots Moscone in his office and then goes to meet Milk, where he guns him down, with the fatal bullet delivered execution style. The film suggests that Milk believed that White might be a closeted gay man.Edelstein D. ""\'Milk\' Is Much More Than A Martyr Movie."" NPR. November 26, 2008. Accessed on: January 3, 2009. The last scene is a candlelight vigil held by thousands for Milk and Moscone throughout the streets of the city. Pictures of the actual people depicted in the film, and brief summaries of their lives follow.', 'West Texas in June 1980 is desolate, wide open country, and Ed Tom Bell  laments the increasing violence in a region where he, like his father and grandfather before him, has risen to the office of sheriff. Llewelyn Moss , hunting pronghorn, comes across the aftermath of a drug deal gone awry: several dead men and dogs, a wounded Mexican begging for water, and two million dollars in a satchel that he takes to his trailer home. Late that night, he returns with water for the dying man, but is chased away by two men in a truck and loses his vehicle. When he gets back home he grabs the cash, sends his wife Carla Jean  to her mother\'s, and makes his way to a motel in the next countyThe sign in front of Moss\' trailer park indicates its location in Sanderson, the seat of Terrell County. Del Rio is the seat of Val Verde County, approximately 120 miles  from Sanderson. where he hides the satchel in the air vent of his room. Anton Chigurh  is a hitman who has been hired to recover the money. He has already strangled a sheriff\'s deputy to escape custody and stolen a car by using a captive bolt pistol to kill the driver. Now he carries a receiver that traces the money via a tracking device concealed inside the satchel. Bursting into Moss\' hideout at night, Chigurh surprises a group of Mexicans set to ambush Moss, and murders them all. Moss, who has rented the connecting room on the other side, is one step ahead. By the time Chigurh removes the vent cover with a dime, Moss is already back on the road with the cash. In a border town hotel, Moss finally finds the electronic bug, but not before Chigurh is upon him. A firefight between them spills onto the streets, leaving both men wounded. Moss flees across the border, collapsing from his injuries before he is taken to a Mexican hospital. There, Carson Wells , another hired operative, offers protection in return for the money. After Chigurh cleans and stitches his own wounds with stolen supplies, he gets the drop on Wells back at his hotel and kills him just as Moss calls the room. Picking up the call and casually raising his feet to avoid the spreading blood, Chigurh promises Moss that Carla Jean will go untouched if he gives up the money. Moss remains defiant. Moss arranges to rendezvous with his wife at a motel in El Paso to give her the money and send her out of harm\'s way. She reluctantly accepts Bell\'s offer to save her husband, but he arrives only in time to see a pickup carrying several men speeding away from the motel and Moss lying dead in his room. That night, Bell returns to the crime scene and finds the lock blown out in his suspect\'s familiar style. Chigurh hides behind the door of a motel room, observing the shifting light through an empty lock hole. His gun drawn, Bell enters Moss\' room and notices that the vent cover has been removed with a dime and the vent is empty. Bell visits his Uncle Ellis , an ex-lawman. Bell plans to retire because he feels ""overmatched,"" but Ellis points out that the region has always been violent. For Ellis, thinking it is ""all waiting on you, that\'s vanity."" Carla Jean returns from her mother\'s funeral to find Chigurh waiting in the bedroom. When she tells him she does not have the money, he recalls the pledge he made to her husband that could have spared her. The best he will offer is a coin toss for her life, but she says that the choice is his. Chigurh leaves the house alone and carefully checks the soles of his boots. As he drives away, he is injured in a car accident and abandons the damaged vehicle. Now retired, Bell shares two dreams with his wife , both involving his deceased father. In the first dream he lost ""some money"" that his father had given him; in the second, he and his father were riding horses through a snowy mountain pass. His father, who was carrying fire in a horn, quietly passed by with his head down, ""going on ahead, and fixin\' to make a fire"" in the surrounding dark and cold. Bell knew that when he got there his father would be waiting.', 'Two professional assassins are sent to kidnap a 9 year old boy named Travis Knight , who is under the United States Federal Witness Protection Program after witnessing a mob killing in Texas. Cohen  is the older, jaded assassin with a little bit of humanity still in him. Tate  is the younger, hotheaded and psychopathic killer. The two hitmen assassinate the boy\'s parents and the agent who protected them with the help of another agent who lets them get in the house and then runs away. They capture Travis, and then they bring him in the car with them. They have to take Travis before their employer, in Houston, according to their orders. When Travis hears this from Cohen himself, he seizes the rising antagonism between his hijackers and starts entangling and putting one against the other in order to survive. When his captors are distracted Travis escapes and is soon picked up by a trooper, who is later shot in the head by Cohen while he\'s driving. Once again they capture Travis and then they hear on the radio that the boy\'s father survived the attack and is only injured, and the police are after their trail. Tate wants to get rid of Travis but Cohen does not. They suddenly find a Roadblock ahead and manage to escape by threatening to kill Travis and blowing up the police patrols. They swap cars with a driver after he gets brass knuckles in the face from Tate. Cohen suddenly stops driving and parks beside a mailbox. Without saying a word, with an expression of grief , he sends part of his payment and his money clip in a letter to his wife. Travis finally manages to turn his captors on each other, when he realizes that Tate is about to shoot the sleepy Cohen while he is driving. He shouts at Cohen, warning him. This enrages Tate, who calls Travis a liar. Travis spits at Tate, and when Tate tries to harm him, he gets shot and chucked out of the moving car by Cohen, who later stows his body in the trunk. A stop at the gas station leaves an overly curious attendant getting shot through a glass door after he sees blood coming out of the car\'s trunk while attempting to call for help. Cohen goes to check on Tate only to be attacked on by his now-enraged and still-alive partner, who springs out of the trunk and batters Cohen senseless. He reveals himself to have been wearing a bulletproof vest. Travis manages to drive the car away from Tate and hide among pump jacks and oil tanks in an oil field. Cohen reappears and handcuffs Travis to his wrist. Tate stalks them in the dark. When Cohen moves abruptly to shoot where he thinks Tate is, he loses his Hearing Aid. Travis finds it but hesitates about speaking out. Cohen looks at Travis with fear in his eyes, and pleads for help. Travis gives him the hearing aid and Cohen thanks him. While escaping, Tate suddenly comes out and shoots Cohen, who takes a round to the shoulder and appears to pass out. Tate advances on Travis before being shot by Cohen, causing him to fall beneath an oil pump jack and be splattered everywhere by the equipment. When he gets to Houston, Cohen is cornered on the highway by the police and considers shooting Travis, but the boy lets him know that he can\'t do it and they both know it. Cohen collides with a roadblock in his last attempt to escape. When the car breaks down, he is totally surrounded. Holding Travis close to him, he cocks his gun, and asks him: ""How old are you, kid""? Travis answers ""nine."" Then, while looking up, Cohen says: ""Nine, huh? How about that?"" and shoots himself in the throat, dying instantly.']"

One day in July, he discovers they have inherited the Hotel Majestic, a long-closed facility in Bethany, Pennsylvania — and along with it, $8,000 in unpaid taxes .<ref namehttp://news.google.com/newspapers?idT24DAAAAIBAJ&pgplaying-for-keeps+hawley&hlUricchio|first\'Playing for Keeps\' is lacking in content|dateSeptember 15, 2011|work16}} Danny\'s great-aunt Theresa once owned the place, but died before she could pay them off. Unknown to them, a firm called Pritchard Chemicals is willing to acquire the property for its Fox River project, and turn it into a chemical waste dump. Danny discusses the scenario with two friends: a would-be entertainer named Silk Davis, and an athletic type named Spikes McClanahan. To earn enough money for keeping the Majestic, Danny attempts to open a bank account, while Silk and Spikes become suburban salespeople—but to no avail. Afterward, the three disguise themselves as members of the Boy Scouts, and successfully sell a lot of mint cookies to office workers. Danny eventually makes Marie proud, not only with his earnings, but with a bundle of food supplies for a few needy neighbors. Soon, he and his friends travel to Hawley on a decorated van, but the worn-down state of the Majestic catches them off-guard. Rockefeller G. Harding, a residing hermit, gives them a tour that leaves the newcomers more appalled. They begin to renovate the building and transform it into ""The New Hotel Majestic...For Kids Only"", promising ""MTV in every room"" once it re-opens. But several of the townsfolk express their displeasure over what could happen to their town, and even take measures to keep Danny and friends out of their lives. Meanwhile, Rockefeller suggests that Danny recruit stockholders to manage the hotel. In doing so, Danny scouts the New York streets and hires many of his friends for that purpose. Arriving in Hawley, the stockholders of Majestic Enterprises are as dismayed as Danny, Spikes and Silk previously were; the luxury they expected of the Majestic is nowhere in sight. Instead, they are put to the task of fixing up the place within a month, after which inspection will take place.', 'For most of his childhood, 17-year-old Michael Oher  has been in foster care with different families, largely because of his mother\'s drug addiction, throughout Memphis, Tennessee. Every time he is placed in a new home, he runs away. His friend\'s father, whose couch Mike had been sleeping on, asks Burt Cotton ([[Ray McKinnon , the coach of Wingate Christian school, to help enroll his son and Mike. Impressed by Mike\'s size and athleticism, Cotton gets him admitted despite his abysmal academic record. At his new school, Michael is befriended by a boy named Sean Jr. ""SJ"" . SJ\'s mother Leigh Anne Tuohy  is a strong-minded interior designer and the wife of wealthy businessman Sean Tuohy . Leigh Anne notices Michael walking on the road, shivering in the cold; when she learns he intends to spend the night huddled outside the school gym, she offers him a place to sleep at her house. The next morning, when she sees Michael leaving, she asks him to spend the Thanksgiving holiday with her family. Slowly, Michael becomes a member of the Tuohy family, even as Leigh Anne\'s rich friends wonder what she is doing. One even suggests that her teenage daughter Collins  is not safe around him, much to Leigh Anne\'s disgust. When Leigh Anne seeks to become Michael\'s legal guardian, she learns he was separated from his drug-addict mother when he was seven and that no one knows her whereabouts. She is also told that even though he scored low in almost every category in a career aptitude test, he is in the 98th percentile in ""protective instincts"". After his grades improve, Michael is allowed to join the school football team. He has a shaky start due to his polite and gentle nature, yet after some encouragement by Leigh Anne to tap into his ""protective instincts"" and regard his teammates as he would members of his family, Michael dominates on the field. SJ sends out videos of the games to college coaches around the country. Leigh Anne discovers that to get a NCAA Division I scholarship, Michael needs a 2.5 GPA, so they hire a tutor, Miss Sue . Some of the teachers help out as well, and Michael ends up with a GPA of 2.52. When coaches come to recruit Michael, Leigh Anne makes it clear that she prefers the University of Mississippi  as both she and her husband are alumni. Miss Sue, another Ole Miss alumna, tells Michael  that the FBI buries body parts under the University of Tennessee\'s Neyland Stadium for research; Leigh Anne particularly loathes that school. Michael commits to Ole Miss. Subsequently, Michael and the Tuohys become the subject of an NCAA investigation. The investigator tells Michael that the Tuohys and Miss Sue are fervent Mississippi boosters, who are subject to special restrictions, and his high school coach got a job at Ole Miss after Michael chose the school. Michael confronts Leigh Anne, asking her if she only took him in so he would play football for her alma mater. Michael then goes to his birth mother\'s apartment in the projects. His old friends welcome him, but their leader makes crude remarks about Leigh Anne and Collins. Michael becomes angry and in the ensuing fight subdues his former friends and then flees. Leigh Anne searches for Michael. He finally calls her, and they meet. Leigh Anne tells him she will support any decision he makes. Michael satisfies the investigator by explaining that he chose Ole Miss because his whole family has gone there. Later, Leigh Anne and her family take Michael to the Ole Miss campus to begin college. The film ends with an emotional goodbye between Leigh Anne and Michael. The closing credits show the 2009 NFL Draft with the real Michael Oher being drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round. Photographs of Oher and the real Tuohys follow, with Oher\'s success in the NFL detailed. The credits include a dedication to director John Lee Hancock\'s father, a football player and coach who died in 2009.', '{{plot}} The story follows music composer/singer Winslow Leach ([[William Finley , who is seen by satanic record producer Swan ([[Paul Williams  during his performance as a back-up act to the nostalgia band The Juicy Fruits, whom Swan produces. Swan is deeply moved by Winslow\'s song, and, deeming Winslow\'s music as the perfect music to open ""The Paradise"" – Swan\'s highly anticipated new concert hall – has his right-hand man Arnold Philbin  steal it. When Winslow arrives at Death Records, Swan\'s record label, he is thrown out. When he sneaks into ""The Swanage"", Swan\'s private mansion, to find out what\'s going on, he observes several women all rehearsing his music for an audition. One of them is Phoenix , an aspiring singer, whom Winslow deems perfect for his music and the two quickly fall for one another. Winslow is told of Swan\'s plan to open the Paradise with Winslow\'s music. When Winslow sneaks in once more, Swan orders he be thrown out again and for his minions to beat up Winslow and frame him for drug dealing. Winslow is given a life sentence in Sing Sing Prison. In prison, Winslow\'s teeth are extracted as part of an experimental prisoner program funded by the Swan Foundation. His teeth are now replaced with shiny metal ones. Six months later, Winslow hears on the radio, while assembling tiddlywinks games in the prison rehab center, that The Juicy Fruits, whom he hates, have made an anticipated hit record of his music with Swan\'s backing. Winslow goes berserk, punches out a guard and escapes from prison in a delivery box driven off prison property. He breaks into the Death Records building and tears the place up. He then breaks into Swan\'s record factory where he sets out to destroy a record press. When a guard catches him fiddling with the record press, Winslow slips and the record press catches his sleeve, tumbling him head first into the record press which crushes and burns his face and destroys his vocal cords. Bleeding profusely and with his face now severely mutilated, a very disoriented Winslow makes his way to the edge of the East River and tumbles into the water. The newspaper reports the details of the night and that his body was not recovered. Sneaking into the Paradise, Winslow makes his way into the costume department where he dons a black leather costume, a long, black cape  and a silver, owl-like mask to cover his now scarred face, becoming the Phantom of the Paradise so he can terrorize Swan and his musicians. He plants a time bomb on a prop car and nearly kills The Beach Bums . Swan, seeing the Phantom on a security camera, realizes there is an intruder about. The Phantom confronts Swan who recognizes him as Winslow. Swan offers the composer the chance to have his music produced his way. Auditions are held and the Phantom selects Phoenix. Later, in a secluded recording studio, Swan provides the Phantom with an electronic voice-box, enabling him to speak and sing (but with the voice of [[Paul Williams . Swan asks the Phantom to rewrite his cantata for Phoenix. The Phantom reluctantly agrees on the condition that Phoenix is the lead singer and that Swan plays ""what I write!"" Swan promises and the Phantom signs a contract in blood. Swan is later shown bitterly listening to the recording session with Winslow: while he sounded normal at the time, the tapes mysterious play back Swan\'s voice as ragged, wicked and monstrous-sounding. While the Phantom remains in the recording studio rewriting his cantata, Swan breaks the deal by telling Philbin that he resents Phoenix\'s ""perfection"" for the lead role: ""You know how I abhor perfection in anyone but myself."" Swan puts a pill-popping, effeminate male glam rock prima uomo simply dubbed ""Beef""  in the lead of Winslow\'s Faust with Phoenix as a backup singer. Beef is revealed to the media at a press conference where all cameras and recording devices are strictly banned, as per Swan\'s policy. After days of isolation, the Phantom completes Faust, Swan having gotten him hooked on uppers in the process. Swan steals the completed cantata while ordering his minions to seal the Phantom up inside the recording studio with a brick wall. However, when the Phantom awakens that night to realizes he has been betrayed again he manages to escape in a fit of fury. The Phantom then confronts Beef (in a comic allusion to the shower scene in [[Psycho  and threatens to kill him if he performs. Beef tries to flee, but is stopped by Philbin, who suggests to Beef that it was all a drug-induced hallucination. Onstage the glam-rock band The Undeads , costumed to resemble the sonambulist from The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, sing of the ultimate man, appearing to dismember audience members  and making a show of appearing to turn the parts into Beef, now costumed as a glitter-clad Frankenstein\'s monster. As Beef performs a completely rewritten glam-rock version of Winslow\'s ""Old Souls"", the Phantom, hidden in the rafters, strikes and electrocutes Beef  with a lightning-bolt-shaped neon sign. Horrified, Philbin orders Phoenix onstage as a replacement. Phoenix, singing the true version of Winslow\'s music at last, is an immediate sensation with the audience. As they continue to cheer for Beef outside as his dead body is loaded into an ambulance, Swan now realizes the potential of the situation. In Phoenix\'s dressing room, Swan arrives and seduces Phoenix, telling her of her future stardom. As she leaves, she is nearly overwhelmed by the zealous crowd, but is quickly carted away by the Phantom. On the roof, the Phantom tells Phoenix his true identity. He implores Phoenix to leave the Paradise so Swan won\'t destroy her like he has destroyed everything else. Phoenix does not believe him and, fearing the Phantom, flees. At the Swanage, the Phantom observes Swan and Phoenix locked in a tight embrace. Heartbroken, he commits suicide by stabbing himself through the heart with his own knife. However, the Phantom awakens from death to see Swan standing over him. Pulling the knife out, Swan tells the Phantom that he cannot die because he is locked to the blood contract he had signed earlier: The Phantom cannot die until Swan himself has died. With that knowledge, the Phantom attempts to stab Swan through the heart, but Swan is unharmed and merely pulls the knife away replying, ""I\'m under contract, too!"" Rolling Stone announces the upcoming wedding between Swan and Phoenix during Faust{{\'}}s finale. While everyone prepares, the Phantom sneaks into Swan\'s private taping room to watch the tape containing the blood contract. Watching the tape, the Phantom then learns that Swan made a pact with the devil over twenty years ago: Swan will remain youthful forever unless the videotaped recording of his contract is destroyed. Future photos, videos and recordings of Swan will age and fester in his place, explaining why he abhors being caught on film. The tape goes on to reveal footage of Winslow signing his contract with Swan and finally a new one Swan made with Phoenix when she was stoned, promising him ""her voice"" upon her death . Then, on a live TV camera, the Phantom observes a hit man assembling a rifle and realizes Swan is planning to have Phoenix assassinated during the ceremony. The Phantom destroys all the recordings by setting them on fire and heads off to the wedding between Phoenix and Swan. The wedding is in full swing onstage, with Philbin officiating and Swan wearing gloves and a silver mask of his own face to prevent being properly filmed. The Phantom manages to throw off the assassin\'s aim to stop him from hitting Phoenix, causing him to shoot and kill Philbin instead. With the tapes destroyed and Swan now mortal once again, the Phantom swings down onto the stage and rips off Swan\'s mask, finally exposing him as a monster on live television. Swan\'s face is now hideous, burning away like the tapes and contracts. Realizing what\'s happening, a crazed Swan gropes for Phoenix\'s throat, demanding she give him her voice, beginning to strangle her. The Phantom intervenes and stabs Swan repeatedly in the chest with the metal beak of a backup dancer\'s bird-shaped headpiece. The moment he does, his own fatal wound reopens. As he is dying, Swan is carried around by the audience, who are driven to the point of hysteria and join in stabbing him. The dying Winslow also removes his mask to reveal his own face, and cheered on by the crowd, crawls on the floor towards the shocked Phoenix. Just as he holds out a hand to her, Swan dies, allowing Winslow to die of his own wound. As Winslow collapses, Phoenix finally recognizes him as the kind man she met in line. Phoenix rushes over and lies down next to him, crying and heartbroken as the audience raves. The closing credits feature a series of montages of the cast members, identifying each by name, commencing with the musical trio and concluding with Winslow/The Phantom. Most of the shots in these montages are from the film, but there are also several from outtakes.']"

However, he refuses oral sex from his elderly neighbor Tillie , which results in falling down the stairs and almost getting attacked by a dog. Seeing the repercussions of saying no, he goes back to Tillie. While initially disgusted with the thought, Carl is ultimately pleasured by Tillie and thoroughly enjoys his time spent with her. Carl starts to seize every opportunity that comes his way. He renews his friendship with Pete and Rooney, builds up a bond with his boss, Norman , assists Pete\'s fiancée, Lucy , attends Korean language classes, joins a Persian dating website, and much more. Saying yes constantly works to Carl\'s advantage. He earns a corporate promotion at work and, making use of his guitar lessons, plays Third Eye Blind\'s song ""Jumper"" to persuade a man not to commit suicide. Accepting concert tickets from a promoter, he sees an idiosyncratic band called Munchausen by Proxy whose lead singer turns out to be Allison. He is charmed by her quirkiness; she is charmed by his spontaneity and the two begin dating. As their relationship develops, Carl and Allison meet at the airport for a spontaneous weekend excursion. Having decided to take the first plane out of town, regardless of its destination, they end up in Lincoln, Nebraska, where they bond more. As they take shelter from rain, Allison asks Carl to move in with her and he hesitantly agrees. While checking in for the return flight, Carl and Allison are detained by FBI agents who have profiled him as potential terrorist because he has taken flying lessons, studied Korean, approved a loan to a fertilizer company, met an Iranian, and bought plane tickets at the last minute. Pete, his attorney, travels to Nebraska to explain Carl\'s odd habits, lessons, and decisions. As she finds out about Carl\'s motivational covenant, Allison begins to doubt whether his commitment to her was ever sincere. Deciding that she can no longer trust him, Allison leaves Carl and refuses to return his phone calls. Carl\'s life takes a turn for the worse, and he almost forgets about Lucy\'s shower. He manages to arrange a major surprise shower, set his friend Norm up with Soo-Mi , a Korean girl, and Rooney with Tillie. After the party, Carl receives a tearful phone call from Stephanie, whose new boyfriend has walked out on her. When Carl goes to Stephanie\'s apartment to comfort her, she kisses him and asks whether they can get back together. After Carl emphatically says no, his luck takes a turn for the worse and he decides to end his commitment to the covenant. Carl goes to the convention center and hides in the backseat of Terrence\'s convertible so that he can beg to be released from the covenant. Carl emerges as Terrence drives off, and the startled Terrence collides with an oncoming vehicle. The two are taken to a hospital. After Carl recovers consciousness, Terrence tells Carl that there was no covenant. The starting point was merely to open Carl\'s mind to other possibilities, not to permanently take away his ability to say no if he needed to. Freed from this restraint, Carl finds Allison and admits that he is not ready to move in with her just yet, but that he genuinely loves her. The couple are reunited. At the end of the movie, Carl and Allison are seen donating a truckload of clothes to a local homeless shelter. Cutting to the scene of the ""Yes!"" seminar, Terrence is seen walking onstage to several hundred naked audience members. It is implied that the participants have said yes to donating their clothes to charity. Halfway through the credits, Carl and Allison are seen donning on 31-wheel roller suits and racing down a hillside. The suits are fictionalized as invented by one of the people Carl had approved a loan with. The suits are a real life invention of the French designer Jean-Yves Blondeau.<ref namehttp://www.newtonsnation.com.au/newsItems/40|titleNovember 2010|publisher21 June 2011}}']"

Will\'s parents are The Commander  and Jetstream , the world\'s most famous superheroes. Will\'s best friend is Layla , who has the power to manipulate plant life. Will is anxious about attending Sky High, located on a floating campus reached by flying school bus, because, unbeknownst to his parents, he has not developed any super powers. The first day he and the other freshman are harassed by a trio of bullies: the super fast Speed , Lash  who can stretch his body, and cheerleader Penny  who can create duplicates of herself. Because of his lack of powers, Will is slated to enter a curriculum for ""Hero Support"" and become a sidekick. His classmates include Ethan  who can melt into a puddle, Zach  who glows in the dark, Magenta  who turns into a purple guinea pig, and Layla who joins the class in protest against the two track nature of the school\'s education. The class is taught by The Commander\'s former sidekick ""All American Boy"" . The Commander, unaware that his son has been relegated to Hero Support, shows Will his secret trophy room. He is particularly proud of the mysterious weapon ""The Pacifier"" which he took from his science themes arch-nemesis Royal Pain years ago. Unknown to either of them, Royal Pain, who had been presumed dead, watches the exchange from a hidden camera in one of the other trophies. As Will settles in to Sky High and makes friends with the other sidekicks he comes into conflict with fire wielding student Warren Peace , whose supervillain father had been imprisoned by The Commander. During a fight between the two, Will demonstrates super strength, impressing Gwen Grayson , a beautiful and popular ""technopath"" who controls machines with her mind. Will begins spending more time with Gwen and her popular friends, ignoring the sidekicks and Layla, who reveals to Warren that she has loved Will for a long time. On the day before the dance, Gwen tricks Will into throwing a party at his house, and Speed steals the Pacifier when she seduces Will into showing her the Secret Sanctum. After Gwen is cruel to Layla, who shows up to investigate the noise, Will breaks up with Gwen refusing to attend the dance even though his parents are going as honored guests. Later, he looks through his father\'s old yearbooks and sees a student who looks just like Gwen. Believing that the student is Royal Pain and that Gwen is her daughter he rushes to the dance. At the dance party, Gwen reveals that she is in fact Royal Pain. During her previous confrontation with the Commander, the Pacifier, which is meant to turn its target into an infant, had malfunctioned, turning her into a baby instead. She has since waited sixteen years for revenge. With the help of Speed, Lash, and Penny, she takes over the school and uses the Pacifier to turn the faculty and students into infants. When Will arrives at school, he apologizes to Layla and teams up with Warren and the sidekicks to try and save the day. The sidekicks demonstrate their heroism after Royal Pain sabotages the school\'s anti-gravity drive and their powers come in handy restarting it. Will, meanwhile, discovers that he also has his mother\'s powers of flight when he is thrown off the edge of the school grounds and must prevent the campus from falling. Gwen and her henchmen are defeated and arrested and the faculty and students are returned to their proper ages.

Distracted, he bumps into the back of a florist\'s van and damaging his stock. Unfazed, Donald and his budgie take their groceries and leave, abandoning his taxi cab and passengers. He takes his groceries to the self-help group for autistic adults. Before they head to the park to meet another autistic group, he tells one member, Gracie, to gather the women and he\'ll gather to guys to practice telling personal stories, but keeps getting distracted by performing mathematical sums of the microwaves depleting numbers. He notices that Isabelle Sorenson, a new name, has signed up and tells Gracie to let her go first. At the park, Isabelle tells of a childhood memory to the women: she saw that her parents were happy that an Olympian had broken a record, so in order to please her parents, and taking what she heard literally, she broke their music records. Donald tells his story to the men about his ability to do complex sums but couldn\'t make friends. Isabelle goes on to tell of when she was raped when she went hitch-hiking. This causes Gracie to laugh manically. Heard by Donald, he tries to calm an angry Isabelle down and they find that they have much in common and take a liking to each other. In the self-help group, after Isabelle talks to Gregory about Donald, he calls Donald over to ask her to escort him to the Hallowe\'en party. Before Donald can, Isabelle asks Donald out for lunch. They go to the zoo the following day, and in response to Donald asking on behalf of Gregory, Isabelle asks Donald to escort her. They agree to meet with their costumes on in the evening. Donald dresses as a whale but is hesitant about going and leaves Isabelle, dressed as Mozart, waiting. She goes to his apartment and they both walk around the town talking until the final bus is due, and they share their first kiss. Unsure when to call, Donald leaves multiple messages on her phone until she finally answers and they go to the amusement park. In the ring toss, the clanging of the metal rings hitting the bottles and the bell ringing cause her to scream and collapse on the floor. He takes her back to his filthy apartment and they agree to sleep together. The following day at the self-help group, Gregory accuses Donald of exploiting his position for sexual favours. Isabelle makes herself liked by going with Bronwin, who learns that her father has blood cancer, to wait for her parents to pick her up. Isabelle takes the liberty of cleaning his apartment while he goes shopping. When he returns, he\'s horrified to see that everything is different; the piles of newspaper are stacked neatly, rotting food from the fridge is thrown away and has a new shower curtain. He gets angry at Isabelle for changing everything. He later leaves a number of apologetic messages on Isabelle\'s phone. The next day, he goes to the hair salon where Isabelle works as a hair stylist to apologize in person, and Isabelle forgives him, introducing him as her boyfriend to the staff. Isabelle shows Donald an abandoned rooftop, calling this a place where people who don\'t know where they belong can belong. She suggests that they can buy a house and her therapist has organised a job interview for a statistic analyst post at a university. He gets the job and they move into their new house, making it their own. Donald tells Isabelle that he wants everything to be ""nice"" for when his boss comes for dinner. Believing that he thinks that she doesn\'t keep the house ""nice,"" Isabelle spites Donald by keeping the pets uncaged, much to Donald\'s shock when he returns, and she maintains extroverted behaviour and tells of her off-the-wall plans for the house. Donald explodes, but when Isabelle says that they are both crazy, he retaliates by telling her that she is crazier, which leads to her throwing him out. He stays with Gregory in his house, and after listing to an answer message that Isabelle\'s rabbit, Bongo, has died, he runs to comfort her. Isabelle suggests that they should just be friends. Donald invites Isabelle to a restaurant, where he proposes to her, much to Isabelle\'s dismay. She leaves abruptly back home and overdoeses. Donald returns just in time to take her to hospital, where Isabelle\'s psychiatrist advises him to leave her alone, testing his willpower to refrain from calling her. Donald sees Isabelle leaving the university and follows her to the abandoned rooftop, where he expresses that the only nice thing he had left to give her was not to call, to find that Isabelle was waiting for his call and she missed him. They express their love with a kiss and embrace.

The kidnappers, led by Fok Tak-Nang, return to Grace\'s house, where they kill her maid, and start searching the place. Grace is then taken to an abandoned house, where she manages to repair a destroyed telephone. With the phone, she manages to contact Bob, a single father and debt collector. Bob has promised his son, Kit-Kit, and his sister, Jeannie, that he will meet them at an airport, before Kit-Kit boards a flight to Australia. While talking to Grace on his cellular phone, Bob agrees to help Grace and hands his phone to patrol officer Fai, who believes that the distressing phone call is a prank, due to Bob\'s reckless driving. Grace is interrupted from the call when Fok and his men enter the room, having abducted her brother\'s friend, Joe. Fok forces Grace to contact her brother, Roy. After listening to Roy\'s answering machine, Fok kills Joe and leaves with his men, now planning to go after Grace\'s daughter, Tinker. Grace persuades Bob to head to the school and find her daughter before Fok\'s men do. When Bob arrives, he is distracted by the school\'s headmaster, and minutes before the school\'s class dismissal, he finds Tinker too late, when she is abducted by Fok\'s men. Bob goes after the abductors, but winds up losing sight of them in the struggle. After crashing through a truck, Bob later finds a handgun left in his car by a fellow debt collector. Realizing that his phone has a low battery, Bob heads to a phone store to buy a cell phone charger. After losing his patience with the flirty service clerk, he holds the store at gunpoint and pays for the charger. After Bob is caught on camera at both the school and the phone store, Fai heads to Grace Wong\'s residence. He is still convinced that the kidnapping situation is a prank, having talked to Michelle, a woman impersonating Grace. Fok then decides to go after Grace\'s brother, Roy, who is in a hospital. Fai decides to call Grace\'s house, after realizing the real Grace Wong is a Mandarin-language speaker, while the impersonator he met speaks Cantonese. At the hospital, Bob manages to distract Grace\'s abductors, who are revealed by police to be Interpol agents. The agents, however, succeed in kidnapping Roy and take him to a hill where he has hidden a camcorder. Bob intervenes, grabbing a hold of the camera and fleeing from the agents; unfortunately, he loses connection with Grace. Fai heads to Grace\'s house, where he confronts and kills Michelle, realizing she was also an Interpol agent working for Fok. As Grace tries to contact Bob, she is caught by one Fok\'s henchmen. Grace kills the henchman and manages to find her daughter. However, while planning to escape, Grace and Tinker are caught by Fok. Bob looks at the evidence on the camcorder. The footage, captured by Roy, reveals Fok brutally executing several American drug dealers and stealing their contraband. Bob calls Fok, and tells them to meet him at the airport in an exchange for the evidence and the hostages, while attempting to keep his promise to his son. At the airport, Bob\'s plans to meet his sister and son are foiled as Fok conveniently stands between them and Bob\'s hiding place. After telling Fok to go towards the parking lot, he demands that Grace, Roy and Tinker be released. They flee to a patrol car that is also in the lot. Unfortunately, Bob is caught by Fok and his men, and fights against them until Fai catches up to them. Fok and his men are arrested by Detective Cheung and his Serious Crimes Unit. After Bob hands the videotaped evidence over to Detective Cheung, Fok and Tong, one of Fok\'s henchman, appear, and Cheung reveals that he was working with Fok. Fok deletes the footage on the videotape, and a violent confrontation ensues in a loading dock in the airport where Fai and Bob take on Fok, Cheung and the corrupt Interpol agents. Cheung is shot to death by Fai after attacking the patrol officer with a forklift truck. Bob confronts Fok on a scaffolding. After Bob reveals he still has videotaped evidence on his cell phone and threatens to send it to the police, Fok kicks Bob off the scaffolding. A net manages to save Bob\'s fall, but sends Fok falling to his death. While this was going on, a member of Fok\'s team rekidnaps Grace and her family and prepares to kill them, but Grace manages to defend her family long enough for the police to arrive. When Bob returns, Fai talks to him, feeling the glory he once had as a police officer, and wishing that they never meet again after their ordeal. Bob then meets Grace for the first time in person. Grace thanks him, and Bob concludes their meeting by saying, ""If you\'re gonna call for help, no thanks! If you want dinner, then I\'ll consider."" Bob is then reunited with his son, who is happy that his father kept his promise.']"

The research project is led by Dr Amanda Hayes  and funded by Murdoch , a well-known industrialist. While visiting the facility, Murdoch agitates the male anaconda with a large flashlight, and he is gassed to calm him down. However, as Murdoch, his assistant Pinkus , and a scientist leave, the anaconda breaks through his enclosure\'s wall. As it escapes, it kills many of the people working in the lab,Cupboard escapes the destruction. In looking through the facility, Amanda and another researcher realize that the second  anaconda has also escaped. Murdoch calls in a team of animal hunters, led by Hammett , to capture both snakes. Amanda and Pinkus go with them. At a small farm in the middle of the woods, the owner is eaten alive by one of the snakes. The hunting party arrives later and begin formulating a plan of attack. During the first confrontation with the snake, two of the party are killed: Captain Gronzy is stabbed by the genetically altered Anaconda\'s very sharp knifed-tail and Dragosh loses his head. Hammett arrives and gives the team a lecture on how to kill the snake. As the group splits up, Amanda heads into a car with two other team members: Victor  and Sofia . During the next confrontation with the snake, a car crash results, the Anaconda spat Victor burning his face very hot, injuring Sofia with a cracked leg and leaving Amanda in the car. As Amanda is about to help her. the snake reappears and crunches Sofia. Amanda is rescued by Hammett and both of them escape. As they regroup, Amanda reluctantly reveals that the queen snake is pregnant and will give birth to more genetically ""special"" offspring in less than 24 hours. The teams wants to call in the military, but Hammett forbids it and threatens Amanda with jail time for her role in creating it. In the morning, the party begins searching for the snake, but Pinkus has lost his hand then later killed. While Hammett searches for it on foot, Amanda and two of the three remaining hunters: Nick  and Amanda search in the jeep. They spot the snakes going into an old factory, and follow them in to plant explosives around the building. Before they can finish, the black male attacks. Nick helps Amanda escape but is captured himself. Before the snake stabs him, he is able to discharge a grenade, stabbing himself with a knife tail and the snake. Hammett and his last remaining hunter: Andrei  arrive and hear the grenade go off. As the two of them meet Amanda inside the factory, Andrei moves to set the charges, so Hammett kills him, causing Amanda and to realize that Hammett is working for a party wanting a live baby anaconda . Inside the building, the queen gives birth. After wounding Hammett, Amanda sets the timer on the explosives and escapes from the building, leaving Hammett to be attacked by the baby snakes while he tries to reach the bomb. Once she is at a safe distance, the explosives detonate. As she sits by a roadside burning all of her documentation on the snake research, one of Murdoch\'s men drives by, heading from the factory where he found one baby snake still alive, to deliver the snake to Murdoch.', 'Robert ""Rack"" Hansen , a veterinarian in rural Verde Valley, Arizona, United States, receives an urgent call from a local farmer, Walter Colby . Colby is upset because his prize calf has become sick for no apparent reason, and brings the animal to Hansen\'s laboratory. Hansen examines the calf, which dies shortly afterward. Hansen tells Colby he cannot explain what made the animal so ill so quickly, but takes samples of the calf\'s blood to a university lab in Flagstaff. A few days later, Diane Ashley , an arachnologist, arrives looking for Hansen. Ashley tells Hansen that the calf was killed by a massive dose of spider venom, which Hansen greets with skepticism. Undaunted, Ashley tells him the problem is serious and that she wishes to examine the animal\'s carcass and the area where it became sick. Hansen escorts Ashley to Colby\'s farm. Moments after they arrive, Colby\'s wife, Birch , discovers their dog is dead. Ashley performs a quick chemical test on the dog\'s carcass and concludes that like the calf, it died from a massive injection of spider venom. Hansen is incredulous, until Colby states that he recently found a massive ""spider hill"" on a back section of his farmland. He takes Hansen and Ashley to the hill, which is covered with tarantulas. Ashley theorizes that the tarantulas are converging together due to the heavy use of pesticides, which are eradicating their natural food supply. In order to survive, the spiders are joining forces to attack and eat larger animals. Hansen and Ashley return to the Colby farm. As the scientists and the Colbys are walking past a barn, a bull stampedes out; it is being attacked by tarantulas. Ashley notes that the spiders likely will not be afraid to attack people either. Colby douses the spider hill with gasoline and lights it on fire, seemingly destroying the spider menace. However, many of the spiders escape out of a tunnel. Colby is attacked in his truck the next day, sending it over the side of a hill and killing him. Hansen happens upon the accident scene and helps the sheriff, Gene Smith , examine the wreckage. Colby\'s body is found encased in a cocoon of spider webs. Meanwhile, Ashley is notified by her colleagues that a sample of venom from one of the spiders is five times more toxic than normal. Hansen is then told by the sheriff that several more spider hills have been located on Colby\'s property. Hansen, Ashley and the sheriff examine the hills along with the mayor of Camp Verde , who orders the sheriff to spray the hills and the surrounding countryside with a pesticide. Ashley protests, arguing that pesticide use is what caused the problem to begin with and that the town would be better off using birds and rats  to eradicate them. The mayor dismisses the idea, fearing that having a large number of spiders and rats all over the countryside will scare away patrons of the annual county fair. A crop duster is enlisted to spray the pesticide. Once the pilot is airborne, he is attacked by tarantulas, and crashes the plane before he can disperse the spray. The spiders begin their assault on the local residents, killing Birch and Hansen\'s sister-in-law, Terri . Hansen arrives at their home and rescues Terri\'s daughter, Linda from the spiders. Hansen and Ashley take Linda to the Washburn Lodge. They consult with the sheriff, who tells them that the spiders are everywhere and Camp Verde cut off from the outside world. Smith drives into town, while Hansen and the other survivors at the lodge plan to load up an RV and escape. However, the spiders trap them in the lodge, and they barricade themselves inside. Meanwhile, Smith arrives in Camp Verde and finds the town under siege by the spiders. Smith tries to escape, but is killed when another car crashes into a support post under the town\'s water tower, causing it to fall on his vehicle. Back at the lodge, the power goes out, and Hansen is forced to venture into the lodge\'s basement to change a blown fuse. He succeeds, but is besieged by spiders who break through one of the basement windows, by using their combined weight. He makes it upstairs just in time to be saved by Ashley. The film concludes the next day, with the survivors rigging up a radio receiver and listening for news of the attacks. To their surprise, the radio broadcast doesn\'t mention the attacks, indicating that the outside world is oblivious to what has happened. Hansen pries off the boards from one of the lodge\'s windows, and discovers that the entire building is encased in a giant web cocoon. The camera pulls back, and all of Camp Verde is encased in cocoons as well.', 'In the quiet mining town of Prosperity, Arizona, an accident involving a rabbit causes a barrel of toxic waste to land in a reservoir. An exotic spider farmer named Joshua  has been making regular visits to the site, where he collects crickets for his spiders. Although the spiders have ingested the toxins, he is oblivious since the arachnids seem unaffected. Joshua shows Mike , a local boy, his collection, which include Jumping spiders, Trapdoor spiders, Tarantulas, and Orb-weaver spiders, including a female named Consuela. After Mike leaves, Joshua is bitten by an escaped tarantula and accidentally knocks down the spider cages. He is killed by the spiders and, after devouring him, the spiders grow to even huger proportions. On his way home, Mike is accosted by his mother, Sheriff Sam Stroud  and Deputy Pete pulling the toxic barrel out of the pond. Wade, the Mayor of Prosperity, is holding a town meeting in the mall about whether they should sell the mines and relocate. Chris McCormick , whose father owned the mines before he died ten years ago, shows up and stands against Wade\'s proposition. Chris also sparks a romance with Sam. Meanwhile, Harlan Griffiths , an eccentric extraterrestrial enthusiast, is broadcasting his theory that various missing pets around town have been abducted by extraterrestrials. Inevitably his theory is dismissed as the product of a deranged imagination. Mike sneaks out on foot and finds Joshua and the spiders missing, the farm covered in webbing, and the dead body of Joshua. Although he sees an enormous spider shadow in the mines and tells Chris that the spiders have grown to enormous sizes, based on a giant spider leg he found at the mine entrance, Chris disbelieves his story. Meanwhile, the mines have reopened with the miners searching for a famous gold lode. One miner is eaten by a gigantic spider, whose clan have made the mines their home. Seeing as the entire town is connected in some way to the mines, spiders show up in many different places. Deputy Pete Williams  cat has a fight with one of the spiders in the air vents before being eaten and some of the ostriches on Wade\'s farm are devoured by Trap Door Spiders, Ashley breaks up with her boyfriend Bret, and he and his motorcyclist friends are chased by jumping spiders, with him being the only survivor, accidentally cutting off the telephone line and being stuck in the mine. Chris finds out that his Aunt Gladys and her dog are abducted by a male orb weaver in their basement. Sam is convinced Chris and Mike are delusional. However, her skepticism fades and she realizes that Chris and Mike were right all along when she witnesses a giant male orb-weaver attempting to abduct Ashley , her daughter and Chris; Sam saves them both. Meanwhile Bret, still wandering the mines, gets a good peek at the giant Consuela during her feeding. Sam contacts Pete and tells him to bring all guns in the police station\'s possession and they escape to Harlan\'s trailer, knowing he has a radio station that he operates from within his trailer. As Sam broadcasts the threat over the radio, a giant tarantula, the ""tank"" of the horde, assaults the trailer but they manage to escape. As the town is besieged by vicious spider hordes, many people are eaten, Chris tries to convince Harlan that the spiders are ""from Earth"" but ends up convincing him that they are ""Spiders from Mars"" to make him happy, Sam tells everybody to evacuate to the mall. Chris, Sam, Mike, Ashley, Harlan, Wade and many other townspeople all escape and barricade themselves in the mall  and defend themselves from the spiders. Meanwhile, Harlan and Chris climb onto the roof and ascend the radio mast and try to get a signal to call the army as they are being attacked by the spiders, but are believed to be pranksters. Harlan jumps from the roof, after the tarantula breaks open the gates and lets the spiders enter the mall, and lands in some bushes, where he meets up with Pete. The two run from spiders as Chris meets up with the remaining townsfolk and goes down to the basement. Meanwhile Bret, still wandering the mines, encounters the cowardly Wade before his abduction. While the townsfolk are in the basement, Bret arrives on a forklift that brings down the locked gate, and they all head to through the mines straight to the front entrance, discovering the methane-filled tunnels. After losing Norman and freeing Wade, Chris goes to look for his Aunt Gladys in the mines and finds her and the gold his father was searching for, but is confronted by the gigantic Consuela. He uses perfume to distract the spider and the escapes using Bret\'s motorcycle. Chris then blows up the spiders and the mines utilizing Gladys\'s smoking addiction and the high concentrations of methane gas. The police finally arrive. They had not believed the reports of the spiders but believed Harlarn\'s theory that the assailants were extraterrestrial in nature, until Pete tells them that the assailants were ""just spiders, that had ingested extremely high levels of toxic waste."" He tries to show this is true by showing his head, thinking  that his hair grew back, but unfortunately it did not. As the story ends, Harlan is heard making a radio report about the spiders. He concludes that the town has decided to cover up the whole incident, but have let Harlan continue broadcasting the incident, knowing nobody will believe him. He also mentions Chris reopening the gold mines and putting everyone back to work, but tells us ""that is another story altogether."" As the camera zooms in close on his mouth, it is clear that he now has three gold teeth.']"
